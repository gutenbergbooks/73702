  class="x-larger">PREFACE</span></h2>

  <p>Owing to unforeseen circumstances, not unconnected with the foundation of a new University, the
  publication of this volume has been unduly delayed. Some parts of the work have actually been in
  type for more than four years; and although the authors have made every effort to keep them up to
  date, the arrangement is naturally not quite what it might have been if the articles had been
  written immediately before publication.</p>

  <p>In view of the novelty of Mr. Boulenger's classification of the Teleosteans, and of the fact
  that several independent workers have been occupying themselves with the subject during the last
  year or two, it is fair to state that this part of the volume was completed in 1902. Professor
  Herdman's account of the Ascidians was ready for publication two years earlier.</p>

  <p>Professor Bridge wishes to express his best thanks to Dr. R. H. Traquair. F.R.S., for his
  kindness in reading the proofs of the pages which deal with the fossil Crossopterygii,
  Chondrostei, Holostei and Dipnoi, and for much helpful advice and criticism; to Mr. G. A.
  Boulenger, F.R.S., for his valuable and suggestive criticism on certain points; and to Mr. Edwin
  Wilson, for the care which he has taken in the preparation of the figures.</p>

  VERTEBRATA&mdash;HEMICHORDATA&mdash;ENTEROPNEUSTA&mdash;EXTERNAL CHARACTERS AND
  HABITS&mdash;STRUCTURE&mdash;GENERA&mdash;DEVELOPMENT&mdash;PTEROBRANCHIA&mdash;<i>CEPHALODISCUS</i>
  AND <i>RHABDOPLEURA</i>&mdash;PHORONIDEA&mdash;<i>PHORONIS</i> AND ACTINOTROCHA&mdash;AFFINITIES
  OF THE HEMICHORDATA.</span></p>

  <p>The Hemichordata, a marine group which includes the worm-like Balanoglossus, owe much of their
  interest to the fact that they are believed by many zoologists to be related to the lower
  Vertebrates. This view is one of a number of mutually exclusive hypotheses, which seek to derive
  Vertebrate animals from various Invertebrate ancestors. It is supported by many striking
  resemblances between Balanoglossus and the lowest forms which are by common consent regarded as
  belonging to the Vertebrate alliance; but it must be distinctly understood that Balanoglossus is
  at most the much modified modern representative of extinct forms which were also the ancestors of
  Vertebrates.</p>

  <p>The axis of the backbone of all Vertebrates is formed by an elastic rod known as the
  "notochord" (Figs. 72, 115), which lasts throughout life in some of the lowest forms, but in the
  higher forms appears only in the embryo. The universal occurrence of this structure has been
  regarded as the most important characteristic of the Vertebrata and their allies, which are
  accordingly grouped together in the Phylum CHORDATA. The members of this Phylum are further
  distinguished from other animals by several important features. Of these one of the most important
  appears to be the existence of lateral <span class="pagenum" id="page4"><span
  class="smaller">{4}</span></span>outgrowths of the pharynx, which unite with the skin of the neck
  and form a series of perforations leading to the exterior. These structures are the gill-slits,
  and in the Fishes their walls give rise to vascular folds or gills. With the assumption of a
  terrestrial life, the higher Vertebrates lost their gills as functional organs, respiration being
  then performed by entirely different organs, the lungs. But even in these cases, the gill-slits
  appear in the embryo; and remains of one pair can usually be recognised in the adult state of even
  the highest Vertebrates. Another fundamental characteristic of the Chordata is given by the
  central nervous system, which lies entirely above the alimentary canal, just dorsal to the
  notochord. Not only does this position of the nerve-centres distinguish the Chordata from
  Invertebrates, but a further point of difference is found in the development. While in
  Invertebrates the ventral nerve-cord is formed as a thickening of the ectoderm or outermost layer
  of the embryo, in the Chordata the nervous system is usually formed as a longitudinal groove
  running medianly along the back of the embryo. This groove closes to form a tube of nervous
  matter, the cavity of which always persists throughout life as the "central canal" of the spinal
  chord and its anterior prolongation which constitutes the "ventricles" of the brain.</p>

  <p>Although the animals which are considered in this chapter are not admitted by all zoologists to
  be related to the Vertebrates, there can be no question that their respiratory organs closely
  resemble typical gill-slits. Since, moreover, they possess structures which can be regarded, with
  a fair amount of probability, as agreeing in essential respects with the notochord and the tubular
  dorsal nervous system of Vertebrates, it appears justifiable to include them in the Chordata,
  which are then subdivided into (1) <span class="sc">Hemichordata</span>, in which a "notochord"
  occurs in the anterior end of the body only; (2) <span class="sc">Urochordata</span> (Tunicata or
  Ascidians), in which the notochord is restricted to the tail; (3) <span
  class="sc">Cephalochordata</span> (Amphioxus), in which the notochord extends the entire length of
  the body <i>and of the head</i>; (4) <span class="sc">Craniata</span>, in which a brain is
  developed as an enlargement of the central nervous system, the notochord does not extend farther
  forward than the middle of the brain, and a vertebral column is present. These last are thus
  usually known as Vertebrata, although in distinguishing an "Invertebrate" from a "Vertebrate" it
  is more <span class="pagenum" id="page5"><span class="smaller">{5}</span></span>logical to regard
  all Chordata as Vertebrates, since the Invertebrata are in no sense a natural group with common
  characteristics, their union under one name merely implying that they have no close affinity to
  the Vertebrates. It is often convenient in practice to divide animals into Vertebrates and
  Invertebrates, but from a zoological point of view a division of the animal kingdom into Molluscs
  and Non-Molluscs would have as much or as little significance.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The sub-phylum Hemichordata<a id="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> consists
  of the Orders:&mdash;(I.) <span class="sc">Enteropneusta</span>,<a id="NtA_2"

  genera <i>Cephalodiscus</i> (Fig. 9) and <i>Rhabdopleura</i> (Fig. 12). To these should possibly
  be added (III.) <span class="sc">Phoronidea</span>, for the reception of <i>Phoronis</i> (Fig.

  <p><i>Balanoglossus</i>, the largest genus now recognised by Spengel, appears to be practically
  world-wide in its distribution; <i>Schizocardium</i> is recorded from both sides of S. America;
  <i>Glandiceps</i> from the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, Japan, and the Indian Ocean;
  <i>Spengelia</i> from the South Pacific; and other species from the White Sea to New Zealand. The
  habitat is usually sand or gravelly sand, in which the animal forms a kind of tube by means of the
  abundant mucus secreted by its skin. <i>Dolichoglossus kowalevskii</i> (Fig. 1, D), according to
  Bateson,<a id="NtA_9" href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> lives between tide-marks at a <span
  class="pagenum" id="page7"><span class="smaller">{7}</span></span>depth of about eight inches. The
  greater part of the body is coiled in an even, cork-screw-like spiral, while the anterior end,
  including the front part of the branchial region, is maintained in a vertical position. The
  posterior end is also kept upright, and can be moved up and down in a vertical shaft opening on
  the surface, thus enabling the animal to eject the undigested sand from its anus.</p>

  <p>The coloration of Balanoglossus is often brilliant. That of <i>D. kowalevskii</i><a id="NtA_10"
  href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> is as follows:&mdash;The "proboscis" (cf. Fig. 1, B, <i>p</i>)
  is yellowish white; the "collar" (<i>c</i>) is brilliant red-orange (especially in males), with a
  white ring posteriorly; the "trunk" (<i>t</i>), the subdivision of which into "branchial,"
  "genital," "hepatic," "abdominal," and "caudal" regions is better indicated in other species (Fig.
  1, A, <i>b</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>ab</i>), is orange-yellow, shading to green-yellow in the
  semi-transparent caudal region. The genital region is grey in females and yellow in males, a
  sexual difference in colour being common in Enteropneusta. The hepatic papillae of other species
  may be bright green.</p>

  <p>The odour of <i>D. kowalevskii</i> resembles that of "chloride of lime with a faecal
  admixture," while that of <i>Balanoglossus aurantiacus</i> suggests iodoform. All Enteropneusta
  are said to have a more or less offensive smell. A species of Balanoglossus is known to be
  intensely phosphorescent.<a id="NtA_11" href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The mouth (Fig. 7, <i>m</i>) is situated on the ventral side, at the base of the proboscis, and
  is concealed by the free anterior edge of the collar, which encircles the thin "proboscis-stalk"
  (Fig. 3, <i>p.s</i>). The animal has the singular peculiarity of being unable to close its
  mouth;<a id="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> and thus, as it burrows through the ground,
  the sand which passes into the alimentary canal leaves it in a continuous column through the
  terminal anus.<a id="NtA_13" href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> The large coiled "castings" formed
  in this way between tide-marks enable the experienced collector to infer the presence of
  Balanoglossus; and in a West Indian species described by Willey<a id="NtA_14"
  href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> they are so large as to form "an important feature in the
  landscape at low tide."</p>

  <p>The principal agents in burrowing are the proboscis and collar. An animal observed by Spengel
  pushed the tip of its proboscis into the sand, waves of muscular contraction meanwhile passing
  <span class="pagenum" id="page8"><span class="smaller">{8}</span></span>over the surface of the
  proboscis. At first the animal made slow progress; but the collar, becoming surrounded by sand,
  soon became a point of resistance by means of which the proboscis could bury itself yet more
  deeply. The animal quickly disappeared as soon as the first two regions of its body were engaged
  in the task of burrowing<a id="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This action is due partly to the muscles of the body-wall, but largely to the power possessed
  by the proboscis and collar of becoming swollen and turgid. Spengel has observed that these parts
  become flaccid when the animal is taken out of water, and can only swell again when it is replaced
  therein; and it may thus fairly be concluded that the enlargement is due to the taking in of
  water. This is probably in fact the most important function of the "proboscis-pore" and of the
  "collar-pores" which are described below.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Body-Cavities.</b>&mdash;The existence of five separate body-cavities (Fig. 2) is one of the
  most fundamental facts in the anatomy of Balanoglossus. The first body-cavity, or cavity of the
  proboscis (<i>b.c</i><sup>1</sup>), is single and unpaired; the second body-cavities
  (<i>b.c</i><sup>2</sup>) are paired spaces, one belonging to each side of the collar; the third
  body-cavities (<i>b.c</i><sup>3</sup>) are similarly paired, and correspond with the trunk. While
  there is no connection between successive body-cavities, there are in certain regions
  communications between the two cavities of the same pair. Each of the paired cavities is at one
  time a closed lateral space between the skin and the alimentary canal. As the two spaces which
  constitute the pair grow towards one another, both above and below the alimentary canal, they come
  into such close apposition that they remain separated only by their conjoined walls. In this way
  are formed the dorsal and ventral mesenteries (Fig. 4, <i>d.m</i>, <i>v</i>), the former being the
  only one to persist in the higher Vertebrates. The body-cavities of the adult become to a large
  extent disguised by being traversed by connective tissue and muscles.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page9"><span class="smaller">{9}</span></span></div>

  <p>The hinder part of the proboscis-cavity is divided by the forward growth of the notochord (Fig.
  3, <i>n</i>) into dorsal and ventral portions. The dorsal cavity in extending backwards becomes
  further subdivided into right and left halves, the latter typically opening dorsally to the
  exterior on the proboscis-stalk by an asymmetrical "proboscis-pore" (<i>p.p.</i>). Two symmetrical
  proboscis-pores may, however, occur, or a median pore connected with the left division of the
  proboscis-cavity. These may be individual variations within the limits of a single species, or may
  occur as a normal feature of a species.</p>

  <p>The collar-cavities open by two "collar-pores" (Fig. 3, <i>c.p.</i>), situated at the posterior
  end of the collar, into the first pair of gill-pouches, near their external opening. Willey has
  recently described<a id="NtA_16" href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> vestigial pores in relation
  with the "perihaemal spaces," a pair of dorsally situated outgrowths of the third body-cavities
  into the collar-region. Narrow "peripharyngeal spaces," also a forward growth of the third
  body-cavities, closely invest the pharynx in some species.</p>

  <p><b>Body-Wall and Nervous System.</b>&mdash;The body-wall (Fig. 4) consists externally of a
  thick ciliated epidermis (<i>e</i>), containing numerous gland-cells which secrete an abundant
  mucus. Beneath the epidermis is a basement-membrane, while more internally are layers of muscles,
  whose arrangement differs in different parts of the body and in different species.</p>

  <p>The nervous system consists of a plexus of cells and fibres which lie in the basal part of the
  epidermis of all parts of the animal, outside the basement-membrane; the thicker portions of the
  plexus forming definite nerve-tracts. This intimate connexion <span class="pagenum"
  id="page10"><span class="smaller">{10}</span></span>between the epidermis and the nervous system
  is usually restricted to embryonic life in other animals.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The main nerves of Balanoglossus are a dorsal and a ventral tract in the trunk region (Fig. 4,
  <i>d.n</i>, <i>v.n</i>), a circular tract (Fig. 3, <i>c.n</i>) connecting these two at the
  posterior edge of the collar, and a strong concentration of nerve-tissue round the whole of the
  proboscis-stalk, and of the posterior end of the proboscis (Fig. 3). In the region of the collar
  the nervous system attains its highest development, taking the form of a median cord passing above
  the alimentary canal. This cord, known as the central nervous system (Fig. 7, <i>n.s</i>), runs
  through the cavity of the collar, but is connected with the epidermis at each end. It thus becomes
  continuous in front with the nerve-layer on the proboscis-stalk, while posteriorly it passes into
  the dorsal and the circular nerve-tracts. In nearly all cases the epidermis is pushed into the
  cord at the points where it passes into the skin, in the form of an anterior and a posterior
  "neuropore" (Fig. 3). A transverse section through the extreme front or hind end of the collar
  accordingly shows a tubular nervous system. In certain species, as in <i>Glossobalanus
  sarniensis</i> and <i>Ptychodera flava</i>, a central canal, opening in front and behind, exists
  throughout the entire length of the central nervous system, while in <i>G. minutus</i> a canal of
  this kind occurs in the young animal, but not in the adult. The central nervous system is
  developed as a longitudinal <span class="pagenum" id="page11"><span
  class="smaller">{11}</span></span>dorsal groove in the larva,<a id="NtA_17"
  href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> and in a similar manner in the collar which is formed as the
  result of regeneration after injury.<a id="NtA_18" href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Balanoglossus
  is thus typically provided with a dorsal, tubular, central nervous system, and although this
  arrangement does not extend beyond the limits of the collar, it shows a noteworthy resemblance to
  Vertebrate animals.</p>

  <p>In some cases the central nervous system is connected with the dorsal epidermis by a varying
  number (1-17) of median "roots," which have been compared by Bateson with the dorsal roots of the
  spinal nerves of Amphioxus, and are probably remains of the embryonic connexion of the collar
  nervous system with the dorsal epidermis.</p>

  <p><b>Alimentary Canal.</b>&mdash;The mouth (Fig. 7, <i>m</i>) leads widely into the alimentary
  canal, which, passing through the collar, enters the branchial region, where it is characterised
  by the existence of communications with the exterior. These, the gill-slits, are developed, as in
  Vertebrates, as paired outgrowths of the alimentary canal, and new gill-slits are constantly being
  formed at the posterior end of the branchial region with advancing age. The maximum number of the
  gill-slits, and the extent of the branchial region, are by no means uniform throughout the
  Enteropneusta. Thus <i>Dolichoglossus otagoensis</i> is said to have no more than 12 pairs,
  <i>Glossobalanus minutus</i> only 40 pairs, while <i>Balanoglossus aurantiacus</i> may have as
  many as 700 pairs. In <i>Ptychodera flava</i> the variation is so great that Willey
  distinguishes<a id="NtA_19" href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> two extreme conditions as
  "macrobranchiate" and "brachybranchiate" respectively, although intermediate conditions are also
  found. It should be noted that Balanoglossus agrees with Amphioxus in the indefinite number of the
  gill-slits.</p>

  <p>The gill-slits usually have the form of the so-called "branchial pouches" or "gill-sacs" (Figs.
  5, 6, <i>g.s</i>). Each ordinarily opens to the exterior by a small pore (Fig. 1, D, 5,
  <i>g.p</i>) or slit, situated on the dorsal side, in a shallow longitudinal groove not far from
  the middle line. The gill-sac has a complete wall of its own, and lies between the alimentary
  canal and the body-wall, communicating with the former by a <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped
  slit. While a dorsal <span class="pagenum" id="page12"><span
  class="smaller">{12}</span></span>view of the animal thus shows a linear series of simple pores, a
  view of the pharynx from the inside appears as in Fig. 5.</p>

  <p>At the hind end of the pharynx the inner opening of the developing gill-sac is circular.
  Slightly further forward the dorsal side of the pore is indented into a crescent, which grows
  longer in a dorso-ventral direction, and becomes a <span class="sans fwb">U</span>, whose two
  limbs are nearly separated by a mass of tissue, the so-called "tongue-bar" (Fig. 5, <i>t</i>). The
  special interest of this mode of development is that it is identical with what occurs in Amphioxus
  (p. 120), which is universally admitted to belong to the Chordata.</p>

  <p>The gill-sacs of Balanoglossus follow one another closely, the hind wall of one being in
  contact with the front wall of the next, and constituting a "branchial septum" (<i>b.s</i>). Both
  septa and tongue-bars are supported by chitinous rods, which are special thickenings of the
  membrane at the base of their epithelium. Two rods occur in each tongue-bar, separated by an
  interval of body-cavity (Figs. 5, 6), and only one rod in each septum. Originally of this
  form&mdash;<span class="sans fwb">&#x2229;&#x2229; &#x2229;&#x2229;</span>&mdash;the rods have
  joined in pairs, the united limbs forming the single rod of each branchial septum. In this respect
  again we have a similarity between Balanoglossus and Amphioxus, except that in the latter the
  concrescence proceeds one step farther, and the two rods of the tongue-bar unite, like those of
  the branchial septum. The latter, the so-called "primary" skeletal rods of Amphioxus, are forked
  ventrally as in Balanoglossus (Fig. 5).</p>

      indicate the communications of the gill-sacs with the exterior and with the pharynx.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In Amphioxus, as in most Enteropneusta, adjacent rods are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page13"><span class="smaller">{13}</span></span>connected at intervals by chitinous
  "synapticula" (Fig. 5, <i>s</i>), which traverse one or the other of the halves of the gill-slit.
  In <i>Dolichoglossus</i>, where no synapticula occur, the tongue-bars may be turned inside out by
  slight pressure, and then project to the exterior through the gill-pores.</p>

  <p>The subdivision of the branchial region of the alimentary canal into two parts, as shown in
  Fig. 4, is characteristic of <i>Glossobalanus</i> and its allies. In <i>Dolichoglossus</i> and
  <i>Glandiceps</i> there is no such constriction, the region occupied by the gill-slits being
  merely the dorsal half of a tube with a simple circular section. <i>Schizocardium</i> (Fig. 6)
  agrees with Amphioxus in the fact that the gill-slits occupy nearly the whole of the wall of the
  pharynx; the only parts not perforated by gill-slits being the small dorsal and ventral
  portions.</p>

  <p>In <i>Ptychodera</i> (Fig. 4), the gill-sacs are practically absent. The <span class="sans
  fwb">U</span>-shaped slits of the pharyngeal wall thus open directly to the exterior,<a
  id="NtA_20" href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> and can be seen from the outside. In species which
  have this arrangement, the genital wings are greatly developed, so as to arch over the back of the
  branchial region. The gill-slits thus open into a kind of "atrium," resembling that of Amphioxus
  in its relation to the gill-slits, and in having the generative organs on its outer side, but
  differing from it in being dorsal to the pharynx.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>At a certain distance behind the branchial region, the alimentary canal in <i>Balanoglossus</i>
  and <i>Schizocardium</i> is produced into a series of outgrowths, into which food does not pass.
  These "liver-sacs" give rise to corresponding folds (Fig. 1, A, <i>h</i>) <span class="pagenum"
  id="page14"><span class="smaller">{14}</span></span>of the dorsal body-wall, a conspicuous
  external feature of the species in which they are present. The most interesting peculiarity of the
  digestive tract in this region is the existence, in certain species, of pores, possibly vestigial
  gill-slits, leading from it to the exterior.</p>

  <p><b>Notochord and Skeleton.</b>&mdash;The structure compared by Bateson with the Vertebrate
  notochord is a hollow dorsal outgrowth of the alimentary canal of the collar-region (Fig. 7,
  <i>n</i>). Near its origin it is slender, but in the proboscis it dilates into a comparatively
  large organ, which in most cases retains its cavity. Its cells have a vacuolated appearance, which
  recalls the fine structure of the Vertebrate notochord. In <i>Schizocardium</i> and
  <i>Glandiceps</i>, the organ is produced into a slender "vermiform process" (<i>v</i>), which
  extends nearly to the tip of the proboscis.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      proboscis-skeleton; <i>v</i>, vermiform process of notochord. (After Spengel.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The main support of the proboscis-stalk is the "proboscis-skeleton" (<i>s</i>), a <span
  class="sans fwb">Y</span>-shaped organ whose median part lies beneath the base of the notochord,
  its diverging legs extending backwards along the outer side of the alimentary canal of the collar.
  The proboscis-skeleton, like the branchial skeleton, is a special development of the structureless
  membrane which is found at the base of the layers of cells <span class="pagenum" id="page15"><span
  class="smaller">{15}</span></span>of Balanoglossus, and in most species it grows merely by the
  deposition of laminae of chitin from the notochord, and from the ventral epidermis of the
  proboscis-stalk.</p>

  <p>In some species, however, and particularly in <i>Balanoglossus aurantiacus</i> and
  <i>Glandiceps</i>, the primary skeleton becomes surrounded by an extensive development of a
  secondary cartilaginoid skeleton, consisting of a structureless substance into which the adjacent
  body-cavities of the proboscis and collar send cellular outgrowths. The possibility of a relation
  between this tissue, more or less surrounding a part of the notochord, and the cartilage of
  Vertebrates cannot be overlooked.</p>

  <p>The caudal region may be stiffened (?) by a "pygochord"<a id="NtA_21"
  href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> which is a median derivative of the alimentary canal on its
  ventral side.</p>

  <p><b>Vascular System and Proboscis-Gland.</b>&mdash;The main vessels are a dorsal and a ventral
  vessel (Fig. 4, <i>d.v</i>, <i>v</i>), lying in their respective mesenteries. The details of the
  vascular system are complicated, and have not been thoroughly made out, the nearly colourless
  character of the blood making their investigation a difficult matter. The following points may,
  however, be noted. The blood is said to pass forwards in the dorsal vessel, which, like the
  ventral vessel and a pair of lateral vessels in the hepatic region, is contractile. In the collar
  the dorsal vessel lies between the two perihaemal spaces, on the dorsal side of the base of the
  notochord. The principal blood-space in the proboscis (Fig. 7, <i>b</i>) lies between the
  notochord (<i>n</i>) and an organ known as the "heart-vesicle" or "pericardium" (<i>p.c</i>). The
  latter has muscular walls and it contracts rhythmically in the larva. Its behaviour in the adult
  is not so easily made out, but it is probable that, although it does not communicate with the
  vascular system, its contractions propel the blood contained in the space immediately beneath it.
  The blood, after passing to a glandular organ, the "proboscis-gland" or "glomerulus," which lies
  at the sides and in front of the notochord, appears to pass round the collar to the ventral
  vessel. Various systems of vessels are connected with the skin, the gills, the alimentary canal
  and the generative organs.</p>

  <p>The function of the proboscis-gland is possibly excretory. In this case it is probable that the
  proboscis-pore eliminates the <span class="pagenum" id="page16"><span
  class="smaller">{16}</span></span>waste products discharged by the gland into the anterior
  body-cavity, though this view is not favoured by Willey.</p>

  <p><b>Reproductive Organs.</b>&mdash;The sexes are separate, the reproductive organs consisting of
  a series of simple or branched glands which occur along the dorso-lateral lines of the anterior
  part of the body; being usually found throughout the branchial and generative regions and ending
  at the beginning of the hepatic region. The reproductive organs may pass into great extensions of
  the body-wall known as the "genital wings," specially developed in some species of
  <i>Balanoglossus</i> and <i>Ptychodera</i> (Figs. 1 A, 4).</p>

  <p><i>Stereobalanus canadensis</i>, a species with long slit-like external gill-pores, is
  interesting in possessing a well-developed genital wing both dorsally and ventrally to the series
  of gill-pores of each side.</p>

  <p>Each reproductive gland opens by its own pore or pores directly to the exterior. Several glands
  and pores may occur in the same transverse section.</p>

  <p>According to Spengel there is no definite relation between the number of the reproductive
  organs and that of either the gill-sacs or the liver-outgrowths. The only definite segmentation
  exhibited by Balanoglossus is thus the division into three regions which is so distinctly shown by
  the arrangement of the body-cavities; though the gill-sacs may indicate an incipient further
  segmentation of the major part of the body. In this connexion it is interesting to notice
  MacBride's statement<a id="NtA_22" href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> that the body-cavity of
  Amphioxus develops in the embryo as five cavities, just as in Balanoglossus; the segmented part of
  the body being formed by a secondary segmentation of the third body-cavities.</p>

  <p><b>Regeneration.</b>&mdash;Balanoglossus, like <i>Phoronis</i> (<span class="wnw">p. <a

  part of the body is readily re-formed, while Spengel has shown<a id="NtA_23"

  regenerated, apparently from a fragment of the body.</p>

  <p>The name <i>Balanoglossus</i> was introduced by Delle Chiaje in 1829 for <i>B. clavigerus</i>
  (Fig. 1, A), from the neighbourhood of Naples. As Spengel has shown, its etymology has been much
  misunderstood. The second half of the name refers to a fancied resemblance between the
  Balanoglossus, with its largely developed genital wings, and the tongue of an ox. <span
  title="Balanos" class="fsn">&Beta;&#x03AC;&lambda;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> means
  "acorn," and it has usually been supposed that this name was suggested by the resemblance of the
  proboscis, projecting from the collar, to an acorn in its cup, a view which finds its expression
  in the <span class="pagenum" id="page18"><span class="smaller">{18}</span></span>name "Eichelwurm"
  used by German zoologists. But the idea expressed by Delle Chiaje was really a similarity between
  the collar of <i>Balanoglossus</i> and the outer shell of <i>Balanus</i>, the barnacle or
  "acorn-shell" found everywhere on rocks between tide-marks.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Development.</b>&mdash;The free-swimming, larval stage of Balanoglossus is known as
  <i>Tornaria</i> (Fig. 8, A).  Several distinct forms of the larva are known,<a id="NtA_27"
  href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> although it is not yet possible to refer them with certainty to
  their respective adults.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page19"><span class="smaller">{19}</span></span></div>

  <p>Tornaria was described and named by Johannes M&uuml;ller, who regarded it as the larva of a
  Starfish,<a id="NtA_28" href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> in spite of his intimate knowledge of
  the development of these animals. Its correct systematic position was first demonstrated by
  Metschnikoff in 1869.</p>

  <p>The larva agrees with many other pelagic forms in being excessively transparent. The form
  described by Spengel as <i>T. grenacheri</i> attains the remarkable length of 9 mm. (nearly
  &#x2156;th inch).</p>

  <p>The full-grown larva is usually ovoid, and a complicated "longitudinal" band of cilia runs in
  several loops over its anterior two-thirds. In side view, part of the surface limited by the
  ciliated band appears like a <span class="sans fwb">T</span> with a double outline, the cross
  piece being bent downwards on each side, so as to form an anchor-like curve, the middle of which
  is at the anterior pole of the larva. In <i>T. krohni</i>, which occurs on our south coast,<a
  id="NtA_29" href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> the ciliated band has a wavy course. In the West
  Indian larva<a id="NtA_30" href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> shown in Fig. 8 A, the ciliated band
  is produced into numerous tentacles, which fringe the sides of the <span class="sans
  fwb">T</span>-shaped areas or grooves of the surface. These grooves and the cilia which border
  them are used for conveying food to the mouth.<a id="NtA_31" href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> At
  the apex of the larva is a thickening (<i>e</i>) of the ectoderm, bearing two eye-spots. The main
  locomotor organ is a simple transverse band (<i>c.r</i>) of "membranellae," vibratile structures
  composed of fused cilia. The mouth (<i>m</i>), on the ventral side, leads into the oesophagus, and
  this into the stomach (<i>s</i>). The latter is separated by a marked constriction from the
  intestine, which opens by the anus (<i>a</i>) at the posterior pole.</p>

  <p>On the dorsal side is a pore, the "dorsal pore" (<i>d.p.</i>), which leads into a thin-walled
  sac (<i>b.c</i><sup>1</sup>) destined to become the proboscis-cavity of the adult. To the right of
  the dorsal pore lies the pulsating "heart," which apparently becomes the pericardium of the adult.
  Bourne and Spengel regard it as a right proboscis-cavity. In the older larvae, the second and
  third body-cavities appear as paired thin-walled sacs in close contact with the hinder part of the
  stomach. The skin is very thin, and the five body-cavities do not nearly fill the space between it
  and the <span class="pagenum" id="page20"><span class="smaller">{20}</span></span>alimentary
  canal. This space becomes obliterated for the most part by the enlargement of the body-cavities,
  and its last remains persist, as in many other animals,<a id="NtA_32"
  href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> as the vascular spaces of the adult.</p>

  <p>In <i>Dolichoglossus kowalevskii</i>, and probably in other species with large eggs,<a
  id="NtA_33" href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> development proceeds by gradual stages to the adult
  form, and no Tornaria-stage is passed through. The opaque young animal, on being hatched, creeps
  about in the muddy sand in which the adult is found, later moving in a leech-like manner, by
  alternately attaching itself by its two ends. The young stages were ingeniously obtained by
  Bateson, to whom our knowledge of the development of this species is due,<a id="NtA_34"
  href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> by allowing a large quantity of the mud to settle after being
  stirred up, the layer of the specific gravity corresponding with that of the young Balanoglossus
  being then separated by means of a siphon. The young stages previously contained in several
  hundredweight of mud were thus easily collected into a pint of water. Morgan recommends treating
  the layer obtained by a similar process with picric acid, which stains the young Balanoglossus
  yellow.</p>

  <p>The embryo early becomes a "blastosphere" or hollow vesicle formed of a single layer of cells.
  One half of this is invaginated, or pushed into the other half, and a "gastrula" is thus
  developed, the cavity of which is the "archenteron," and the two cell-layers respectively
  "ectoderm" and "endoderm." The "blastopore," or orifice of invagination, is at the posterior pole
  of the larva, where it narrows and closes, the locomotor, transverse band of cilia developing
  round it. No other bands of cilia appear in this form of development. The proboscis becomes marked
  out externally by the appearance of a circular groove, near the middle; and behind this groove a
  second one appears, which forms the posterior boundary of the collar. The larva, which now
  resembles Fig. 8 C, is usually hatched at this stage. Two gill-slits make their appearance, and
  the mouth and anus are perforated; the anus being in the position of the blastopore.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page21"><span class="smaller">{21}</span></span></div>

  <p>The body-cavities are formed as five derivatives of the archenteron. One of these is unpaired,
  and becomes the proboscis-cavity; while the others are the paired cavities of the collar and trunk
  (cf. Fig. 2). There is some uncertainty about the origin of the body-cavities of the free-swimming
  Tornaria, although it seems most probable that they are developed either from the wall of the
  stomach or intestine,<a id="NtA_35" href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> or from scattered mesoderm
  cells<a id="NtA_36" href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> which lie in the segmentation-cavity.</p>

  <p>The metamorphosis of Tornaria is accompanied by a great diminution in size,<a id="NtA_37"
  href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> probably due to the loss of water; by this cause and by the
  simultaneous thickening of the skin, the larva loses its transparency.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The external features of the metamorphosis are sufficiently indicated by Fig. 8,
  the ciliated bands finally disappearing. The dorsal pore persists as the proboscis-pore; the
  notochord and numerous gill-slits are developed as outgrowths of the alimentary canal, the
  reproductive organs make their appearance, probably from the mesoderm,<a id="NtA_38"
  href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> the trunk meanwhile elongating so that the proportions of the
  adult are acquired.</p>

  <p>The structure of <i>Rhabdopleura</i> has been described by Sars,<a id="NtA_40"
  href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> Lankester,<a id="NtA_41" href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> and
  Fowler.<a id="NtA_42" href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> <i>R. normani</i> is common in certain
  Norwegian Fjords, at depths of 40 fathoms or more, and has been recorded by Fowler from the
  Tristan d'Acunha group in the S. Atlantic; <i>R. compacta</i> has been found off the N.E. coast of
  Ireland<a id="NtA_43" href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> and near Roscoff, on the N. coast of
  Brittany; while forms described by Jullien<a id="NtA_44" href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> as
  <i>R. grimaldii</i> and <i>R. manubialis</i> have been dredged off the Azores. I have recently
  found a fragment of <i>Rhabdopleura</i> from South Australia. It is doubtful how far these species
  are distinct.</p>

  <p><i>Cephalodiscus dodecalophus</i><a id="NtA_45" href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> was found in
  the Straits of Magellan, during the "Challenger" voyage, at a depth of 245 fathoms, and has
  recently been rediscovered in shallower water in the same neighbourhood by the Swedish Antarctic
  Expedition. Another <i>Cephalodiscus</i>, at present undescribed, has been obtained by Dr.
  Levinsen from 100 fathoms off the coast of Japan; while the Dutch expedition carried out by the
  "Siboga" has resulted in the discovery of two other specimens, one from a reef close to low-tide
  mark on the coast of Borneo, the other from 41-52 fathoms off Celebes. These three specimens
  differ markedly from one another and from the "Challenger" specimen of <i>C. dodecalophus</i>, and
  it is probable that they all belong to new species. The occurrence of a deep-sea animal at a great
  distance from the locality at which it was first found is not in itself a matter for great
  surprise; but in the present instance two of the newly discovered forms are from shallow water,
  and one of them is actually littoral. The occurrence of so many species of <i>Cephalodiscus</i> in
  Oriental waters suggests that the Pacific or the Indian Ocean may be the headquarters of the
  genus, which may prove to be far less of a rarity than has hitherto been <span class="pagenum"
  id="page24"><span class="smaller">{24}</span></span>supposed. There is evidence derived from the
  results of the "Siboga" expedition that abyssal animals may migrate into comparatively shallow
  water in the Malay Archipelago.</p>

  <p><i>Cephalodiscus</i> and <i>Rhabdopleura</i> are remarkable for their power of producing buds.
  In the former these arise from the apex of a stalk which is given off on the ventral side of the
  body, and they break off when they reach a certain age; in the latter they do not become free, and
  a colony results, which consists of a creeping "stolon" from which vertical branches are given off
  at intervals, each ending in an individual of the colony. <i>Cephalodiscus</i> forms a gelatinous
  "house" (Fig. 9, A), in the passages of which are found large numbers of the free individuals,
  together with their eggs and embryos. <i>Rhabdopleura</i> (Fig. 12) is protected by cylindrical
  tubes, one of which corresponds with each individual.</p>

  <p><i>Cephalodiscus</i>, though no more than two or three millimetres in length, is provided with
  practically all the important organs possessed by Balanoglossus. Its proboscis or "buccal shield"
  (Fig. 10, <i>ps</i>) is a large flattened structure, which overhangs and entirely conceals the
  mouth. The anterior body-cavity opens to the exterior by two symmetrically placed proboscis-pores
  (<i>p.p</i>), just in front of the tip of the notochord (<i>nch</i>). The collar, which has paired
  body-cavities, is produced dorsally into 4-6 <span class="pagenum" id="page25"><span
  class="smaller">{25}</span></span>pairs of plume-like arms, which bear an immense number of
  pinnately-arranged tentacles. The arms, which may end in a swollen bulb,<a id="NtA_46"
  href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> have ventral grooves along which food doubtless travels to the
  mouth by ciliary currents. The anterior edge of the ventral half of the collar is drawn out into a
  narrow flap or operculum (Fig. 11, <i>op</i>), in front of which is the mouth, and behind it the
  gill-slits (<i>g</i>) and collar-pores (<i>c</i>). The central nervous system (<i>n.s</i>) is a
  thick mass of nerve-tissue in the dorsal epidermis of the collar; it is not sunk beneath the skin
  as in Balanoglossus. The details of the nervous and vascular systems, and the development of the
  buds, have been described by Masterman. In the dorsal region of the collar the alimentary canal
  has a slender diverticulum, the notochord, which passes into the base of the proboscis; it is
  believed by Masterman to have a function similar to that of the neural gland (cf. <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page52">52</a></span>) of Tunicates.</p>

  <p>The next part of the alimentary canal, the pharynx,<a id="NtA_47"
  href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> has a single pair of simple gill-slits opening to the exterior
  immediately behind the collar-pores. The short oesophagus (Fig. 10, <i>oes</i>) is followed by the
  wide stomach (<i>st</i>), and this by the intestine (<i>int</i>), which opens by the anus
  (<i>a</i>) near the front end of the body.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

  <p>The trunk contains paired third body-cavities (<i>b.c<sup>3</sup></i>), the septum between
  which and the collar-cavities is slightly behind the line of origin of the operculum. Two ovaries
  (<i>ov</i>) are situated between the pharynx and the last part of the intestine, each opening to
  the exterior dorsally between the central nervous <span class="pagenum" id="page26"><span
  class="smaller">{26}</span></span>system and the anus. Each oviduct (<i>ovd</i>) contains dark
  pigment, which is seen through the dorsal skin on removing the tentacular arms. Eggs, each
  enclosed in a stalked membrane, occur in numbers in the cavities of the gelatinous house. The
  early stages of the development are passed through inside the tubes; but there is at present
  little other information with regard to the embryonic development of the Pterobranchia. The
  specimen obtained by the "Siboga" from Celebes is a male colony with dimorphic individuals, the
  reproductive organs being confined to two-armed zooids with vestigial alimentary canal.</p>

  <p><i>Rhabdopleura</i> differs from <i>Cephalodiscus</i> in its much smaller size,<a id="NtA_48"
  href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> and it is perhaps due to its minuteness that it does not possess
  certain organs found in the latter. The stalk is represented by a long muscular cord, which is
  merely a narrow part of the body. Basally the stalk of each individual passes into a common axis,
  which is for the most part attached to the substance on which the colony is growing, and is to
  some extent branched. The muscular stalk can be contracted into a spiral, thereby retracting the
  animal into its tube. The stalks and the younger parts of the axis which connects them are soft,
  but the older parts secrete a dark brown cuticle, forming a narrow <span class="pagenum"
  id="page27"><span class="smaller">{27}</span></span>tube which becomes embedded in the adherent
  wall of the outer tube. The thin dark axis, to which the name <i>Rhabdopleura</i> refers, is the
  feature by which the animal can most readily be recognised without magnification.</p>

  <p>The outer transparent tube is constructed by the proboscis, or buccal shield, the secretion of
  which appears to be intermittent, so that the tube consists of a series of rings piled on one
  another. The animal crawls up the inside of its tube by means of its proboscis, while it is
  retracted by means of the muscles of its stalk.</p>

  <p>The growing axis ends in a row of young buds, the buccal shields of which early reach a
  relatively large size. The terminal bud gives rise to tube-rings, so that the axis is surrounded
  by a cylindrical outer tube, which becomes interrupted by transverse septa, each bud, except the
  end one, thus lying in a closed chamber. The wall of each chamber becomes perforated, and the
  buccal shield then prolongs this perforation by adding tube-rings, the formation of which
  continues till the tube reaches a considerable length. The bud remains connected with the axis by
  means of its narrow proximal region, which forms its stalk. The adherent part of the adult colony
  thus consists of a row of short tubes, traversed by the common axis of the colony. Each tube is
  produced laterally into the upright tube of an individual.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The general anatomy closely resembles that of <i>Cephalodiscus</i>.<a id="NtA_49"

  <p>The structure and development of <i>Phoronis</i> (Fig. 13), have already been described in Vol.
  II.<a id="NtA_50" href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> of this series; and Masterman's
  investigations, then published in a preliminary form only, are there alluded to. Since then this
  author has published fuller accounts<a id="NtA_51" href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> of his
  results, which, if substantiated, <span class="pagenum" id="page28"><span
  class="smaller">{28}</span></span>would indicate a near relationship between <i>Cephalodiscus</i>
  and <i>Phoronis</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Phoronis</i> is a small tubicolous animal, of gregarious habits, which has usually been
  regarded as related to the Gephyrea. Its body ends in a plume of ciliated tentacles, which can be
  protruded from its tube, and the anus is on the dorsal side, not far from the mouth. In both these
  respects it agrees with <i>Cephalodiscus</i>, but a more striking similarity is asserted by
  Masterman to exist between the latter and <i>Actinotrocha</i>, the larval stage of
  <i>Phoronis</i>. The prae-oral ciliated hood (Fig. 14) of Actinotrocha is regarded as the
  proboscis, and it contains a median cavity, traversed, like that of Balanoglossus, by muscular
  fibres. The collar is the region between the constricted neck and an oblique line, parallel to and
  immediately behind the series of tentacles, which thus belong to the collar. This division has a
  collar-cavity which is said to be distinct from the prae-oral cavity, and is separated by a septum
  from the posterior body-cavity. Its dorsal epidermis contains the central nervous system
  (<i>n.s</i>), which is connected with a system of nerves resembling those of Balanoglossus. A
  median diverticulum of the alimentary canal of this part may be compared with the notochord of
  that animal, but there are no gill-slits.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the body of Actinotrocha corresponds with the trunk of Balanoglossus. Its
  body-cavity is distinct from that of the collar, and is divided by a ventral mesentery, though not
  by a dorsal mesentery. A noteworthy fact is that both Actinotrocha and Tornaria swim by means of a
  ring of strong cilia or membranellae<a id="NtA_52" href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> which
  surrounds the anus.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Important memoirs on the structure of Actinotrocha have recently been published by Ikeda,<a
  id="NtA_53" href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> de Selys Longchamps,<a id="NtA_54"
  href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> Goodrich,<a id="NtA_55" href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> and
  Schultz,<a id="NtA_56" href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> who criticise many of Masterman's
  statements. While it is admitted on all sides that an oblique septum following the line of the
  bases of the tentacles completely subdivides the body-cavity, Masterman's account of the anterior
  cavities is not confirmed, the spaces indicated by <i>b.c<sup>1</sup></i> and
  <i>b.c<sup>2</sup></i> in Fig. 14 being stated to be really continuous with one another, while the
  "subneural sinus" (<i>s.s</i>) is regarded as a part of this space. It appears, however, from the
  account given by Ikeda, and followed by Goodrich, that the old Actinotrocha has two distinct
  spaces in front of the septum. The first of these corresponds with <i>b.c<sup>1</sup></i> + most
  of <i>b.c<sup>2</sup></i> in Fig. 14, and is continuous with the cavities of the larval tentacles.
  Into it project the blind ends of the larval excretory organs, which, according to Goodrich, bear
  numerous "solenocytes" similar to those described by the same author in Amphioxus and in Polychaet
  worms (Fig. 79, <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page127">127</a></span>). The second cavity is a
  relatively small crescent (not shown in Fig. 14), lying on the anterior face of the septum, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page30"><span class="smaller">{30}</span></span>the tips of the crescent
  nearly meeting dorsally, so as to constitute an almost complete ring following the bases of the
  tentacles, into each of which it gives off a blind outgrowth. At the metamorphosis, the crescentic
  space becomes the prae-septal body-cavity and the cavities of the tentacles of the adult, the
  circular blood-vessel of which is formed from the remains of the large prae-septal space of the
  larva. Schultz, in calling attention to the fact that both <i>Phoronis</i> and its larva have a
  striking power of regenerating lost parts, confirms the conclusion that this animal belongs to the
  Hemichordata. He gives reasons, however, for believing that it is in the adult <i>Phoronis</i>
  rather than in the larval Actinotrocha that it is possible to discover the most satisfactory
  evidence of this affinity.</p>

  <p>The metamorphosis<a id="NtA_57" href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> of Actinotrocha is very
  remarkable, and is accompanied by the eversion of a ventral ingrowth of the body-wall. A loop of
  the alimentary canal passes into this eversion, which becomes the main part of the body of the
  adult; and the anus is thereby brought relatively nearer the mouth than in the larva. The
  occurrence of this process may help to explain the position of the anus in the Pterobranchia.</p>

  <p><b>Affinities of the Hemichordata.</b>&mdash;There can be no doubt that some of the
  resemblances, in structure and in development, between Balanoglossus and certain Vertebrates are
  extremely striking. The view that Balanoglossus is related to the ancestors of Vertebrates<a
  id="NtA_58" href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> appears to exclude other views<a id="NtA_59"
  href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> which have been suggested with regard to the same question. The
  Balanoglossus-theory does not explain the similarity between the segmentation and the excretory
  systems of Vertebrates and Chaetopods; but, on the contrary, there are important characters which
  Vertebrates share with Balanoglossus but with no other "Invertebrates." Of these the most
  important appear to be the resemblances between the gill-slits and gill-bars of Balanoglossus and
  Amphioxus; the position, structure and mode of development of the central nervous system; and the
  presence of a structure in the Hemichordata, which may be regarded as the notochord. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page31"><span class="smaller">{31}</span></span>There are other points in
  which Balanoglossus specially resembles Amphioxus, such as the early development, the mode of
  formation of the body-cavities,<a id="NtA_60" href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> and the presence
  of numerous generative organs.</p>

  <p>All these, taken together, make it necessary to consider carefully the claims of Balanoglossus
  to relationship with the ancestors of Vertebrates in making any speculations on this interesting
  problem.</p>

  <p>However improbable it may appear at first sight, it is possible to hold the view that
  Balanoglossus is related at the same time to Vertebrates and to Starfishes and other Echinoderms.
  The similarity between a young Tornaria and a young Bipinnaria-larva of a Starfish is so great as
  to have misled even Johannes M&uuml;ller. The more obvious resemblances are the almost identical course
  of the longitudinal ciliated band in the young stages, and the presence of a dorsal pore. The
  Echinoderm-larva is not, however, provided with eye-spots, nor has it the posterior, or
  transverse, ciliated band of Tornaria.</p>

  <p>Recent studies on the development of Echinoderms<a id="NtA_61"
  href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> have made it probable that the five body-cavities of
  Balanoglossus are represented in the larvae of those animals; and this materially strengthens the
  probability of the view that the respective adults are also allied.<a id="NtA_62"
  href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> It may be added that the relationship which appears to be
  indicated is between Balanoglossus and the bilateral ancestors from which the radially-symmetrical
  Echinoderms are probably descended.</p>

  <p class="sp5">In comparing the Enteropneusta with the Pterobranchia, the disproportionate size of
  the trunk of Balanoglossus may perhaps be explained by assuming that the region of the third
  body-cavities has been enlarged since Balanoglossus branched off from the ancestral stock.<a
  id="NtA_63" href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> The approximation of the anus to the mouth in
  Pterobranchia is perhaps the result of their tubicolous habits.<a id="NtA_64"
  href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> In the position of the central nervous system in the skin of the
  collar, <i>Cephalodiscus</i> appears to be more primitive <span class="pagenum" id="page32"><span
  class="smaller">{32}</span></span>than Balanoglossus, as has been pointed out by Morgan.<a
  id="NtA_65" href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> It is not impossible that the presence of one pair
  of gill-slits in <i>Cephalodiscus</i> indicates that this animal diverged from the ancestors of
  Balanoglossus before the gill-slits were metamerically repeated.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Tunicata</span> are marine animals found in practically all parts of the
  sea, and at all depths. They extend from the Arctic and Antarctic regions to the tropical waters,
  and from the littoral zone down to the abyssal depths of over three miles. They are abundant in
  British seas. They vary greatly in shape and colour, and range in size from an almost invisible
  hundredth of an inch to large masses a foot or more in diameter. And yet most Tunicata have a
  characteristic appearance by which they can be readily distinguished from other animals. They form
  a well-defined group, with definite anatomical characters, and there are no known forms
  intermediate between them and other groups. The Tunicata were formerly regarded as constituting,
  along with the Polyzoa and the Brachiopoda, the Invertebrate Class "<span
  class="sc">Molluscoidea.</span>" They are now known to be a degenerate branch of the lower <span
  class="sc">Chordata</span>, and to be more nearly related to the Vertebrata than to any group of
  Invertebrates.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Tunicata occur either fixed or free, solitary, aggregated or in colonies (see Fig.
  27, <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page64">64</a></span>). The fixed forms, found on the
  sea-bottom, are usually termed "Ascidians," those that are solitary or merely aggregated being
  "Simple Ascidians" or Monascidiae, and those that are organically united into a colony being
  "Compound Ascidians" or Synascidiae. The colonies have been produced by budding, a process which
  is very general in the group, and the members of the colony are conveniently known as
  "Ascidiozooids." Some exhibit <span class="pagenum" id="page36"><span
  class="smaller">{36}</span></span>alternation of generations, and all pass through remarkable
  changes in their life-history, nearly all of them undergoing a retrogressive metamorphosis.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Outline of History.</b></p>

  <p>More than two thousand years ago Aristotle gave a short account of a Simple Ascidian under the
  name of <i>Tethyum</i>. He described the appearance and some of the more important points in the
  anatomy of the animal. From that time onwards comparatively little advance was made until
  Schlosser and Ellis, in a paper on <i>Botryllus</i>, published in the <i>Philosophical
  Transactions</i> of the Royal Society for 1756, first brought the Compound Ascidians into notice.
  It was not, however, until the commencement of the nineteenth century, as a result of the careful
  anatomical investigations of Cuvier<a id="NtA_66" href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> upon the
  Simple Ascidians, and of Savigny<a id="NtA_67" href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> upon the Compound
  Ascidians, that the relationship between these two groups of Tunicata was conclusively
  demonstrated. Up to 1816, the date of publication of Savigny's great work, the few Compound
  Ascidians previously known had been generally regarded as Alcyonaria or as Sponges; and although
  many new Simple Ascidians had been described by O. F. M&uuml;ller<a id="NtA_68"
  href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> and others, their internal structure had not been investigated.
  Lamarck<a id="NtA_69" href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> in 1816, chiefly as the result of the
  anatomical discoveries of Savigny and Cuvier, instituted the class <span
  class="sc">Tunicata</span>, which he placed between the Radiata and the Vermes in his system of
  classification. The Tunicata included at that time, besides the Simple and the Compound Ascidians,
  the pelagic forms <i>Pyrosoma</i>, which had been first made known by P&eacute;ron in 1804, and
  <i>Salpa</i> described by Forsk&aring;l in 1775.</p>

  <p>Chamisso, in 1819, made the important discovery that <i>Salpa</i> in its life-history passes
  through the series of changes which were afterwards more fully described by Steenstrup in 1842 as
  "alternation of generations"; and a few years later Kuhl and Van Hasselt's investigations upon the
  same animal resulted in the discovery of the alternation in the directions in which the wave of
  contraction passes along the heart, and in which the <span class="pagenum" id="page37"><span
  class="smaller">{37}</span></span>blood circulates through the body. It has since been found that
  this observation holds good for all groups of the Tunicata. In 1826, H. Milne-Edwards<a
  id="NtA_70" href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> and Audouin made a series of observations on living
  Compound Ascidians, and amongst other discoveries they found the free-swimming tailed larva and
  traced its development into the young Ascidian.</p>

  <p>In 1845, Carl Schmidt<a id="NtA_71" href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> first announced the
  presence in the test of some Ascidians of "tunicine," a substance very similar to cellulose; and
  in the following year L&ouml;wig and K&ouml;lliker<a id="NtA_72" href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> confirmed
  the discovery, and made some additional observations upon this substance and upon the structure of
  the test in general. Huxley,<a id="NtA_73" href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> in an important
  series of papers published in the <i>Transactions</i> of the Royal and Linnean Societies of London
  from 1851 onwards, discussed the structure, embryology, and affinities of the pelagic Tunicates,
  <i>Pyrosoma</i>, <i>Salpa</i>, <i>Doliolum</i> and <i>Appendicularia</i>. These important forms
  were also investigated about the same time by Gegenbaur, Vogt, H. M&uuml;ller, Krohn, and Leuckart.</p>

  <p>The most important epoch in the history of the Tunicata is the date of the publication of
  Kowalevsky's celebrated memoir<a id="NtA_74" href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> upon the
  development of a Simple Ascidian. The tailed larva had been previously discovered and investigated
  by several naturalists, notably by H. Milne-Edwards,<a id="NtA_75"
  href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> P. J. van Beneden, and Krohn; but its minute structure had not
  been sufficiently examined, and the meaning of what was known of it had not been understood. It
  was reserved for Kowalevsky in 1866 to demonstrate the striking similarity in structure and in
  development between the larval Ascidian and the Vertebrate embryo. He showed that the relations
  between the nervous system, the notochord, and the alimentary canal are practically the same in
  the two forms, and have been brought about by a very similar course of embryonic development. This
  discovery clearly indicated that the Tunicata are closely allied to Amphioxus and the Vertebrata,
  and that the tailed larva represents the primitive or ancestral form from which the adult Ascidian
  has been evolved by degeneration. This led naturally to the view usually accepted at the present
  day, that the group is a degenerate <span class="pagenum" id="page38"><span
  class="smaller">{38}</span></span>side-branch from the lower end of the phylum <span
  class="sc">Chordata</span>, which includes the Tunicata (or Urochordata), Balanoglossus and its
  allies (Hemichordata), Amphioxus (Cephalochordata), and the Vertebrata (or Craniata). Kowalevsky's
  great discovery has since been confirmed and extended to all other groups of the Tunicata by
  Kupffer,<a id="NtA_76" href="#Nt_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> Giard, and others.</p>

  <p>In 1872 Fol<a id="NtA_77" href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> added largely to the knowledge of
  the Appendiculariidae, and Giard<a id="NtA_78" href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> to that of the
  Compound Ascidians. The latter author described a number of new forms and remodelled the
  classification of the group. The most important additions which have been made to the Compound
  Ascidians since Giard's work have been the species described by von Drasche,<a id="NtA_79"
  href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> from the Adriatic, and those discovered by the "Challenger"
  expedition.<a id="NtA_80" href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> The structure and the systematic
  arrangement of the Simple Ascidians have been discussed of recent years mainly by Alder<a
  id="NtA_81" href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> and Hancock, Heller,<a id="NtA_82"
  href="#Nt_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> Lacaze-Duthiers,<a id="NtA_83" href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a>
  Traustedt,<a id="NtA_84" href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> Roule, Hartmeyer, Sluiter<a id="NtA_85"
  href="#Nt_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> and Herdman.<a id="NtA_86" href="#Nt_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> In
  1874 Ussoff investigated the minute structure of the nervous system and of the underlying gland,
  which was first discovered by Hancock, and showed that the gland has a duct which communicates
  with the front of the branchial sac or pharynx by an aperture in the dorsal (or "olfactory")
  tubercle. In an important paper published in 1880, Julin<a id="NtA_87"
  href="#Nt_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> drew attention to the similarity in structure and relations
  between this gland and the "hypophysis cerebri" of the Vertebrate brain, and insisted upon their
  homology. Metcalf has recently added further to our knowledge on this and related matters.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Thaliacea or pelagic Tunicata have of late years been the subject of several
  very important memoirs. The researches <span class="pagenum" id="page39"><span
  class="smaller">{39}</span></span>of Todaro, Brooks,<a id="NtA_88"
  href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> Salensky,<a id="NtA_89" href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a>
  Seeliger,<a id="NtA_90" href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> Korotneff,<a id="NtA_91"
  href="#Nt_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> and others have elucidated the embryology, the gemmation and the
  life-history of the Salpidae; and Grobben, Barrois,<a id="NtA_92"
  href="#Nt_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> and more especially Uljanin,<a id="NtA_93"
  href="#Nt_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> have elaborately worked out the structure and the details of the
  complicated life-history of the Doliolidae. Finally we owe to the labours of Metschnikoff,
  Kowalevsky, Giard, Hjort, Seeliger, Ritter, Van Beneden and Julin, much detailed information as to
  development and life-history, the process of gemmation and the formation of colonies, which has
  added greatly to our knowledge of the position and affinities of the Tunicata and of their natural
  classification.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Structure of a Typical Ascidian.</b></p>

  <p>If a typical "Simple Ascidian," such as the common British <i>Ascidia mentula</i> (Fig. 15), or
  <i>Ascidia virginea</i>, be examined alive and expanded in sea-water it will be seen to bear on
  the upper surface two short projections, each terminated by a wide tubular opening, through which
  the animal, when touched, can emit jets of water with considerable force&mdash;thus accounting for
  the popular name "sea-squirts." The rest of the body is covered by the dull grey tough cuticular
  outer "test" or "tunic" (hence <span class="sc">Tunicata</span>) by means of which the animal is
  attached to a rock or other foreign body. One of the tubular openings, the mouth or "branchial
  aperture," is terminal, and indicates the morphological anterior end; it is surrounded by eight
  lobes. The other opening, the cloaca or "atrial aperture," is on the dorsal edge, from one-third
  to one-half way down the body, and is bounded by six lobes only; consequently the two apertures,
  and so the ends of the body, can be distinguished externally by the number of lobes&mdash;an
  important matter. The area of attachment is usually the posterior part of the left side; in Fig.
  15 the animal is seen from the right hand side.</p>

  <p>If a little carmine-powder, or some other insoluble particles be scattered in the water in
  which the Ascidian is living, the <span class="pagenum" id="page40"><span
  class="smaller">{40}</span></span>particles will be seen to converge to the branchial aperture and
  be sucked in by the inhalent current entering the body. After a short interval a certain
  proportion of the particles will be shot out from the atrial aperture with the exhalent
  current.</p>

  <p>These particles have passed through the pharyngeal portion of the alimentary canal and the
  cloacal passages, with the water used in respiration, but a considerable amount of such particles
  taken in with the water do not reappear, as they are retained by the nutritive organs and pass
  along the remainder of the alimentary canal with the food. The current of water passing in at the
  branchial and out at the atrial aperture is of primary importance in the life of the Ascidian.
  Besides serving for respiratory purposes it conveys all the food into the body and removes waste
  matters both intestinal and renal, and also expels the reproductive products from the body.</p>

  <p><b>The Test.</b>&mdash;The test is notable amongst animal structures for containing "tunicine,"
  a substance which appears to be identical in composition, and in behaviour under treatment with
  various reagents, with cellulose. It is cartilaginous in appearance and consistency, and to some
  extent in structure, as it consists of a clear (or in some cases fibrillated) matrix in which are
  embedded many corpuscles or cells. It is the matrix that contains the cellulose, which may form
  over sixty per cent by weight of the entire test. As the test is morphologically a cuticle, being
  a secretion on the outer surface of the ectoderm (Fig. 16, <i>ec</i>), the cells it contains have
  immigrated to it from the body, and it has recently been shown that many of these are mesodermal
  cells (leucocytes or connective tissue wandering cells, amoebocytes, and in some cases embryonic
  "kalymmocytes," or <span class="pagenum" id="page41"><span

  href="#page56">56</a></span>), which have passed through the ectoderm. This process commences in
  the larval state with the migration of mesenchyme cells from the blastocoele through the epiblast.
  Ectoderm cells, and possibly also some primitive endoderm cells, also take part in forming the
  test. Many of these cells in the test remain small and simple, as the fusiform and stellate
  test-cells; some become pigment-cells, while others enlarge and become vacuolated to form the
  large (up to 0.15 mm. in diameter) vesicular or "bladder" cells&mdash;this is especially the case
  in the outer layer of the test in <i>Ascidia mentula</i> (see Fig. 17, <i>bl</i>) where there are
  innumerable clear vesicles, each surrounded by a thin film of protoplasm and having the nucleus
  still visible at one point of the surface. In some of the Tunicata the test-cells produce
  calcareous spicules of various shapes (see below, p. <span class="wnw">p. <a

  <p>The test also becomes organised by the growth into it of the so-called "vessels." These are
  outgrowths of the body-wall covered by ectoderm and containing prolongations of blood-channels
  from the connective tissue of the "mantle" (body-wall). Fig. 16, <i>t.v</i> shows such an
  outgrowth, and exhibits the general relations of test (cuticle), ectoderm, and mesoderm. It also
  explains how it is that the blood-channel being pushed out as a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page42"><span class="smaller">{42}</span></span>loop gives rise to the double or paired
  "vessels" seen branching through the test (see Fig. 17, <i>v</i>). The two vessels of a pair are
  one blood-channel imperfectly divided by a connective-tissue septum. The blood courses out along
  one side, round the communication in a "terminal knob" at the end, and back down the other side.
  The "terminal knobs" are very numerous, and form a marked feature in the outer layer of the test
  (Fig. 17, <i>t.k</i>); in some cases (<i>Culeolus murrayi</i>), they probably form an accessory
  organ of respiration, while in others (Botryllidae), they pulsate and aid in keeping up the
  circulation.</p>

  <p>The ectoderm is a simple epithelial layer (Fig. 16, <i>ec</i>). It is turned in for a short
  distance at the branchial aperture (mouth), and atrial aperture (cloaca), as a short stomodaeum
  and proctodaeum respectively, lined in each case by a delicate prolongation of the test.</p>

  ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm in a section through the antero-dorsal part of the body. The
  cavity marked <i>p.br</i> is a portion of the atrial cavity lined by ectoderm, and must not be
  confounded with a coelom. The absence of a true coelom in the mesoderm will be noticed in this and
  other figures, and yet the Tunicata are Coelomata, although it is very doubtful whether the
  enterocoel which has been described in the development of some is ever found. The coelom is in any
  case largely suppressed later, and is only represented in the adult by the pericardium and by
  small cavities in the renal and reproductive organs and ducts.</p>

  <p><b>Body-Wall and Cavities of the Body.</b>&mdash;The name "mantle" is given to the ectoderm
  with the parietal mesoderm which form the body-wall inside the test. It is largely formed of
  connective <span class="pagenum" id="page43"><span

  blood-sinuses, and many muscle-bundles large and small running circularly, longitudinally, and
  obliquely, and interlacing in all directions (Fig. 18, <i>m</i>). The muscles are all formed of
  very long fusiform non-striped fibres. The mantle in some Ascidians is often brilliantly
  pigmented&mdash;red, yellow and opaque white, the coloured cells being exactly like those found in
  the blood.</p>

  <p>The mantle forms two well-marked siphons or short wide tubes, which lead in from the branchial
  and atrial apertures. These are surrounded by strong sphincter muscles,<a id="NtA_94"
  href="#Nt_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> and are lined by the invaginated ectoderm and test. The one
  leads into the branchial sac or modified pharynx, and the other into the atrial or peribranchial
  cavity (see Fig. 18, and Fig. 19, <i>p.br</i>).</p>

  <p>Figs. 18 and 19 show the relations of the branchial and peribranchial cavities to one another.
  The peribranchial cavity <span class="pagenum" id="page44"><span
  class="smaller">{44}</span></span>opens to the exterior dorsally by the atrial aperture, forms the
  cloaca along the dorsal edge of the body, and has extensions laterally on each side of the
  branchial sac, with the interior of which it is placed in communication by the secondary
  gill-slits or "stigmata" (Fig 19, <i>sg</i>). Along the ventral edge the mantle is united to the
  wall of the branchial sac, and it is only this union (Fig. 19, <i>end</i>) that prevents the
  peribranchial cavity from completely surrounding the branchial sac.</p>

  <p>The following list of the cavities present in the body of the adult <i>Ascidia</i> may be
  useful at this point<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. The alimentary canal, including the branchial sac. This is derived from the archenteron of
  the embryo, is lined throughout by endoderm, and the system of cavities of the intestinal gland is
  to be regarded merely as an outgrowth from the alimentary canal.</p>

  <p>2. The peribranchial (atrial) cavity, derived from two lateral ectodermal invaginations which
  join dorsally to form the cloaca and open to the exterior by the atrial aperture.</p>

  <p>3. The original embryonic segmentation cavity (blastocoele) remains, where not obliterated by
  the development of the mesodermal connective tissue, as the irregular system of blood spaces, with
  its outgrowths in test and branchial sac. The heart, which has differentiated muscular walls,
  becomes secondarily connected at its ends with these blood spaces.</p>

  <p>4. The pericardium and epicardium (see <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page83">83</a></span>)
  originate as outgrowths from the archenteron. They may therefore be regarded as enterocoelic
  spaces. The pericardium becomes completely closed off and separated from the alimentary canal.
  The epicardium may form paired tubes of great length, and may remain permanently connected with
  the branchial sac.</p>

  <p>5. The cavities of the renal vesicles and of the gonads and ducts are spaces formed in the
  mesoblast. They have been variously interpreted<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) As of the same nature as the blood spaces (blastocoelic), or</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) As formed by a splitting of the mesoblast (coelomic).</p>

  <p>6. The cavity of the neural gland and of its duct opening at the dorsal tubercle is derived
  from the primitive dorsal neural tube of the embryo, and so may be regarded as a part of the lumen
  of the cerebro-spinal nervous system.</p>

  <p><b>Tentacles, etc</b>.&mdash;The branchial aperture leads through the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page45"><span class="smaller">{45}</span></span>branchial siphon into the branchial sac. At
  the base of the siphon, just about the line of junction of the ectoderm of the stomodaeum with the
  endoderm of the mesenteron, is placed a circle of simple hair-like tentacles (Fig. 18, <i>tn</i>)
  which stand out at right angles to the wall, and more or less completely meet in the centre to
  form a delicate, sensory grid or sieve through which all the water entering the body has to pass.
  These tentacles not only act mechanically, but are also sensitive although only scattered sensory
  cells, and no specially differentiated sense-organs are found upon them. Behind the tentacles lies
  the plain, or papillated, prebranchial zone (Fig. 21, <i>p.br.z</i>), bounded behind by a pair of
  parallel and closely placed ciliated ridges with a groove between&mdash;the peripharyngeal
  bands&mdash;which encircle the anterior end of the branchial sac.</p>

  <p>The branchial sac is very large&mdash;much the largest organ of the body&mdash;and extends
  almost to the posterior end of the body, while the rest of the alimentary canal lies upon its left
  side. The food particles, consisting of microscopic plants and animals, are carried in through the
  branchial aperture by the current of water, but most of them do not pass out through the
  gill-slits to the atrium, being entangled in the viscid mucus which passes by ciliary action along
  the groove between the peripharyngeal bands.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page46"><span class="smaller">{46}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Endostyle.</b>&mdash;The mucus just referred to is produced in the long canal-shaped gland
  called the endostyle or hypobranchial groove, which runs along the entire ventral edge of the
  branchial sac (Fig. 18, <i>end</i>). The sides, and especially the floor of the endostyle, are
  richly ciliated, while there are four (or six) strongly-marked, peculiarly-shaped glandular
  tracts, two (or three) on each side (Fig. 20, <i>gl</i>) running along its length, and separated
  by areas of closely-packed fusiform cells with short cilia, amongst which are found some bipolar
  sensory cells.</p>

  <p>This organ corresponds to the hypopharyngeal groove of Amphioxus and the median part of the
  thyroid gland of Vertebrata. It is interesting to notice that the (at least) four longitudinal
  tracts of gland-cells are of remarkable constancy, being found not only in all groups of Tunicata,
  including even the pelagic, tailed Appendicularians, but also in Amphioxus and in the young
  thyroid gland of the Ammocoete. When, in Ascidians, a third marginal glandular tract is added it
  has a different appearance from the two characteristic tracts. The mucus is carried forward by the
  action of the large floor-cilia of the endostyle (Fig. 20) to the groove between the
  peripharyngeal bands, and after encircling the anterior end of the branchial sac and collecting
  the food particles, it passes backwards along the dorsal edge <span class="pagenum"
  id="page47"><span class="smaller">{47}</span></span>of the branchial sac to the oesophagus, guided
  by a membranous fold, the dorsal lamina (Fig. 21, <i>d.l</i>), which is more or less ridged or
  corrugated, and may be armed with marginal tags or even replaced by larger processes (the
  "languets") in some species of Ascidians. In the living animal the lamina has its free edge curved
  to the right hand side in such a manner as to constitute a fairly perfect tube along which the
  train of food passes.</p>

  <p><b>Branchial Sac.</b>&mdash;Thus we have the dorsal lamina (or the languets) along the dorsal
  edge, the endostyle along the ventral edge, and the peripharyngeal bands around the anterior end.
  The wall of the branchial sac itself is penetrated by a large number of channels through which
  blood flows. Some of these run in one direction and some in another, so as to form complicated
  networks, which differ greatly in their arrangement in different Ascidians. Between these
  blood-channels there are clefts ("stigmata"), the secondary or subdivided gill-slits, by means of
  which the current of water passes from the branchial sac to the large external peribranchial or
  atrial cavity. All the stigmata (of which there may be several hundred thousand) in the wall of
  the branchial sac are bounded by cubical or columnar epithelial cells, which are ciliated. These
  cilia, so long as the animal is alive, are in constant motion, so as to drive the water onwards,
  and it is this constant ciliary action in the walls of the branchial sac that gives rise to the
  all-important current of water streaming through the body. In addition to the stigmata there are
  generally one or two much larger elongated slits (Garstang's <span class="pagenum"
  id="page48"><span class="smaller">{48}</span></span>pharyngo-cloacal slits) placed close to the
  dorsal lamina and leading direct to the cloaca.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Fig. 22 shows a small part of the wall of the branchial sac, in which it may be seen that the
  bars containing the blood-channels are arranged in three regular series:&mdash;(1) The "transverse
  vessels" which run horizontally round the wall and open at their dorsal and ventral ends into
  large median longitudinally running tubes, the dorsal blood-sinus (or "dorsal aorta") behind the
  dorsal lamina, and the ventral blood-sinus (or "branchial aorta") beneath the endostyle; (2) the
  fine longitudinal or "interstigmatic vessels" which run vertically between adjacent transverse
  vessels and open into them, and which therefore bound the stigmata; and (3) the "internal
  longitudinal bars" which run vertically, in a plane internal to that of the transverse and fine
  longitudinal vessels. These bars (Fig. 22, <i>i.l</i>) communicate with the transverse vessels by
  short side branches where they cross, and at these points are prolonged into the cavity of the sac
  in the form of hollow papillae. In some Ascidians (e.g. <i>Corella</i> and most of the Molgulidae)
  the interstigmatic vessels are curved so that the stigmata form more or less complete spirals (see
  Figs. 35 and 41). In some species of <i>Ascidia</i>, and other Ascidians, the interstigmatic
  vessels are inserted into the transverse vessel in an undulating course in place of the straight
  line seen in Fig. 22, B, <i>l.v</i>, the result being that the stigmatic part of the wall of the
  branchial sac seems to be folded or thrown into microscopic crests and troughs. This is known as
  "minute plication." In some cases, again (Cynthiidae), the whole wall of the sac is pushed inwards
  at intervals to form large folds visible to the eye (see Fig. 36, A and B). The intersections of
  the internal longitudinal bars with the transverse vessels divide up the inner surface of the
  branchial <span class="pagenum" id="page49"><span class="smaller">{49}</span></span>sac wall into
  rectangular areas called "meshes." One such mesh, containing eight stigmata in a row, is seen in
  Fig. 22, A. The internal longitudinal bars bear papillae at the angles of the meshes, and
  occasionally in intermediate positions. There are frequently horizontal membranes (Fig. 22, B,
  <i>h.m</i>) attached to the transverse vessels between the papillae. There are many "connectives"
  running from the outer wall of the branchial sac to the mantle outside, and allowing the blood in
  the transverse vessels to communicate with that in the sinuses of the mantle (see Fig. 19,
  <i>con</i>).</p>

  <p><b>Heart and Circulation.</b>&mdash;It is one of the notable features of the Tunicata that the
  circulation is not constant in direction, but is periodically reversed.</p>

  <p>The blood of Ascidians is in the main transparent, but usually contains certain pigmented
  corpuscles in addition to many ordinary leucocytes or colourless amoeboid cells. The pigment in
  the coloured cells may be red, yellow, brown, or in some cases blue or opaque white. The blood may
  reach the branchial sac either from the dorsal or from the ventral median sinus according to the
  direction in which the heart is beating at the moment (see below); and it is a most interesting
  and beautiful sight to see the circulation of the variously coloured corpuscles through the
  transparent vessels, and the lashing of the cilia along the edges of the neighbouring stigmata in
  a small Ascidian under the microscope.</p>

  <p>In <i>Ascidia</i> (Fig. 23) the heart is an elongated fusiform tube placed on the ventral and
  posterior edge of the stomach, projecting into a space (the pericardium) which is a part of the
  original coelom, the remainder of which is represented in the adult by the reproductive and renal
  cavities. The wall of the heart is continuous along one edge with that of the pericardium, and the
  heart is to be regarded as a tubular invagination of the pericardial wall, shutting in a portion
  of the surrounding space (the blastocoel of the embryo), and having open ends which communicate
  with the large blood sinuses leading to the branchial sac, to the viscera, and to the body-wall
  and test. The cavity of the heart is not divided and there are no valves. Its wall is formed of a
  single layer of epithelio-muscular cells, the inner, muscular, ends of which are cross-striated
  fibres running round the heart&mdash;the only striated muscular tissue found in the body. Waves of
  <span class="pagenum" id="page50"><span class="smaller">{50}</span></span>contraction pass along
  the heart from end to end, first for a certain number of beats in one direction, and then, after
  an interval, in the other. If a small or young <i>Ascidia</i> be placed alive, left side
  uppermost, in a watch-glass or small trough of sea-water, and examined with a low power of the
  microscope, the heart will be readily seen near the posterior end of the transparent body. It will
  be noticed that the "beating" looks like successive waves of blood pressed through the tubular
  heart from one end to the other by its contractions. After watching the waves passing, let us say,
  from the right hand end of the heart to the left for about a minute and a half (perhaps 60 or 80
  to 100 beats), it will be seen that they gradually become slower and then stop altogether. But
  after seven or eight seconds a faint wave of contraction will start from the <i>left</i> end of
  the heart and pass over it to the right; and this will be followed by larger ones for a minute and
  a half, and then again a pause will occur and the direction change. It has been suggested that the
  cause of this remarkable reversal may possibly be that the heart being on the ventral vessel,
  which is wider than the corresponding dorsal trunk, pumps the blood into either the lacunae of the
  branchial sac or those of the viscera in greater volume than can possibly get out through the
  smaller branchio-visceral vessel in the same time, the result being that the lacunae in question
  soon become engorged, and by back pressure cause the stoppage, and then reversal of the beat. The
  absence of any valves in the heart to regulate the direction of flow obviously facilitates this
  alternation of the current.</p>

  <p>The larger channels through which the blood flows may be lined with a delicate endothelium, but
  the smaller passages are merely spaces in the connective tissue. The heart, although anatomically
  a "ventral vessel," runs in the main dorso-ventrally. The blood-channel leaving the ventral end of
  the heart is the "branchio-cardiac vessel" (Fig. 23, <i>b.c</i>). This gives off a branch which,
  along with a corresponding branch from the "cardio-visceral" vessel (<i>c.v</i>) at the other end
  of the heart, goes to the test, and then runs along the ventral edge of the branchial sac as the
  branchial aorta (<i>b.a</i>), external to the endostyle, communicating laterally with the ventral
  ends of all the transverse vessels of the branchial sac. The cardio-visceral vessel (Fig. 23,
  <i>c.v</i>) after giving off its branch to the test breaks up into a number of sinuses which <span
  class="pagenum" id="page51"><span class="smaller">{51}</span></span>ramify over the alimentary
  canal and the other viscera. These visceral lacunae finally communicate with a third great sinus,
  the "branchio-visceral" vessel (<i>b.v</i>) which runs forward along the dorsal edge of the
  branchial sac as the dorsal aorta (<i>d.a</i>), externally to the dorsal lamina, and joins the
  dorsal ends of all the transverse vessels of the branchial sac. Besides these three chief
  systems&mdash;the branchio-cardiac, the cardio-visceral, and the branchio-visceral&mdash;(see Fig.
  23), there are numerous lacunae in all parts of the body by means of which anastomoses are
  established between the different currents of blood.</p>

  <p>When the heart contracts ventro-dorsally the course of the circulation is as follows:&mdash;the
  blood which is flowing through the vessels of the branchial sac is collected in an oxygenated
  condition in the branchio-cardiac vessel, and after receiving a stream of blood from the test
  enters the ventral end of the heart. It is then propelled from the dorsal end into the
  cardio-visceral vessels, and so reaches the test and the digestive and other viscera; then, after
  circulating in the visceral lacunae it passes into the branchio-visceral vessel in an impure
  condition, and is distributed to the branchial vessels to be purified again. When the heart, on
  the other hand, contracts dorso-ventrally, this course of the circulation is reversed, the "veins"
  and "arteries" exchange functions, and what a minute before was a "systemic," is now a
  "respiratory" heart. This is a phenomenon without parallel in the animal kingdom.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page52"><span class="smaller">{52}</span></span></div>

  <p>All the blood-spaces and lacunae are probably derived, like the cavity of the heart, from the
  blastocoel of the embryo, and are not, like the cavity of the pericardium, a part of the coelom
  (of endodermal origin).</p>

  href="#Nt_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> surface of the nerve-ganglion, there lies a small glandular
  mass&mdash;the neural gland&mdash;which, as Julin first showed, there is some reason to regard as
  the homologue of the hypophysis cerebri of the Vertebrate brain. Metcalf has recently shown that
  the neural gland may be a double structure&mdash;partly cerebral and partly stomodaeal&mdash;as in
  Vertebrates.</p>

  <p>The function of this gland is still somewhat mysterious. It may merely form the viscid
  secretion which is carried along the peripharyngeal bands and down the dorsal lamina. On the other
  hand, it has been suggested that the function of the organ may possibly be renal, for the removal
  of nitrogenous waste matters in the neighbourhood of the nervous system. Finally, it may be a
  lymph gland.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page53"><span class="smaller">{53}</span></span></div>

  <p>The neural gland, which was first noticed by Hancock, may be continued backwards along with the
  dorsal nerve, and it communicates anteriorly by means of a narrow duct with the front of the
  branchial sac (pharynx). The opening of the duct is enlarged to form a funnel-shaped cavity (Fig.
  24, A), which may be folded upon itself, convoluted, or even broken up into a number of smaller
  openings (see Fig. 43, <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page79">79</a></span>), so as to form a
  complicated projection called the dorsal tubercle, situated in the dorsal part of the prebranchial
  zone. The dorsal tubercle in <i>Ascidia mentula</i> is somewhat horse-shoe shaped (Fig. 21,
  <i>d.t</i>); it varies in most Ascidians (see Fig. 43) according to the genus and species, and in
  some cases in the individual also. Sensory cells are found in the epithelium, and so it is highly
  probable that besides being the opening of the duct from the neural gland, this convoluted
  ciliated ridge may be a sense-organ for testing the quality of the water entering the branchial
  sac.</p>

  <p><b>Nervous System and Sense-Organs.</b>&mdash;The single elongated ganglion (Fig. 24,
  <i>n.g</i>), in the median dorsal line of the mantle, between the branchial and atrial siphons, is
  the only nerve-centre in <i>Ascidia</i> and most other Tunicata. It is the degenerate remains of
  the dorsal wall of the tubular cerebro-spinal nervous system of the trunk-region of the tailed
  larval Ascidian&mdash;the ventral wall opposite having given rise to the subneural gland. The more
  posterior or spinal part of the larva has almost entirely disappeared in most adult Tunicata. It
  persists, however, in the Appendiculariidae, and traces of it have been found in the dorsal nerve
  running backwards towards the oesophagus in some Ascidians (e.g. <i>Clavelina</i>). It may be
  ganglionated in Molgulidae.</p>

  <p>The ganglion has small rounded nerve-cells on its surface, and interlacing nerve-fibres inside.
  It gives off distributory nerves at both ends (Fig. 24, A), which run through the mantle to the
  neighbourhood of the apertures, where they divide up to supply the lobes and the sphincter
  muscles. The only sense-organs are the pigment spots ("ocelli," formed of modified ectoderm cells
  imbedded in red and yellow pigment), between the branchial and atrial lobes, the tentacles at the
  base of the branchial siphon, and probably the dorsal tubercle and the languets or dorsal lamina,
  in all of which, as well as in the endostyle and peripharyngeal bands and in papillae on the
  ectoderm and in the branchial sac, sensory cells have been found. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page54"><span class="smaller">{54}</span></span>These, considered as sense-organs, are all in
  a lowly-developed condition. The larval Ascidians, on the other hand, have well-developed
  intra-cerebral optic and otic sense-organs (see Fig. 26, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page60">60</a></span>), and in some of the pelagic Tunicata, otocysts and pigment-spots are
  found in connexion with the ganglion.</p>

  <p><b>Alimentary Canal.</b>&mdash;The mouth and pharynx (branchial sac) have already been
  described. The remainder of the alimentary canal is a bent tube, which in <i>A. mentula</i> and
  most other Ascidians lies imbedded in the mantle on the left side of the body, and projects into
  the peribranchial cavity (see Figs. 18 and 19). The oesophagus leaves the branchial sac in the
  dorsal middle line, near the posterior end of the dorsal lamina. It is a short curved tube which
  leads ventrally to the large fusiform thick-walled stomach, ridged internally. The intestine
  emerges from the ventral end of the stomach and soon turns anteriorly, then dorsally, and then
  posteriorly, so as to form a curve, the intestinal loop, in which the ovary lies, open
  posteriorly. The intestine now curves anteriorly again, and from this point runs nearly straight
  forward as the rectum, thus completing a second curve, the rectal loop, in which the renal
  vesicles lie, open anteriorly. The wall of the intestine is thickened internally to form the
  typhlosole (Fig. 18, <i>ty</i>), a pad which runs along its entire length, so as to reduce the
  lumen of the tube to a crescentic slit. The anus opens into the dorsal or cloacal part of the
  peribranchial cavity near the atrial aperture. The walls of the stomach are glandular, and most of
  the endoderm cells lining the tube are ciliated. A system of delicate, microscopic, branched
  tubules with dilated ends (the "refringent organ"), which ramifies over the outer wall of the
  intestine, and communicates with the cavity of the stomach at the pyloric end by means of a duct
  is probably a digestive gland. There is in <i>Ascidia</i> no separate large gland to which the
  name "liver" can be applied, as in some other Tunicata.</p>

  <p><b>Renal Organ.</b>&mdash;A mass of large clear-walled vesicles which occupies the rectal loop
  (Figs. 18 and 19, <i>ren</i>), and may extend over the adjacent walls of the intestine, is a renal
  organ without a duct. Each vesicle is the modified remains of a part of the primitive coelom or
  body-cavity, and is formed of cells which eliminate nitrogenous waste matters from the blood
  circulating in the neighbouring blood-lacunae, and deposit them in the cavity of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page55"><span class="smaller">{55}</span></span>the vesicle, where they form
  one or more concentrically laminated concretions of a yellowish or brownish colour, sometimes
  coated with a chalky deposit. These concretions contain uric acid, and in a large Ascidian are
  very numerous. The nitrogenous waste products are thus deposited and stored up in the renal
  vesicles in place of being excreted from the body. In other Ascidians the renal organs may differ
  from the above in position and structure; but in no case have they any excretory duct, unless the
  neural gland is to be regarded as one of the renal organs&mdash;which has not yet been proved.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Reproductive Organs.</b>&mdash;<i>Ascidia mentula</i> is hermaphrodite, and the
  reproductive organs lie with the alimentary canal, on the left side of the body (Fig. 19,
  <i>ov</i>). The ovary is a ramified gland which occupies the greater part of the intestinal loop.
  It contains a cavity which, along with the cavities of the testis, is derived from an embryonic
  coelom; the ova are formed from its walls, and fall when mature into the cavity. The oviduct is
  continuous with the cavity of the ovary, and leads forward alongside the rectum, finally opening
  near the anus into the peribranchial cavity (Fig. 18, <i>g.d</i>). The testis is composed of a
  great number of delicate, branched tubules, which ramify over the ovary and the adjacent parts of
  the intestinal wall. These tubules terminate in ovate swellings. Near the commencement of the
  rectum the larger tubules unite to form the vas deferens, a tube of considerable size, which runs
  forward alongside the rectum, and, like the oviduct, terminates by opening into the peribranchial
  cavity close to the anus. The lumen of the tubules of the testis, like the cavity of the ovary, is
  a part of the embryonic mesoblastic space, and the spermatozoa are formed from the cells lining
  the wall. In some Ascidians (certain Molgulidae and Cynthiidae), reproductive organs are present
  on both sides of the body, and in others, as in <i>Polycarpa</i>, there are many complete sets of
  both male and female systems attached to the inner surface of the mantle on both sides of the body
  and projecting into the peribranchial cavity.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Embryology and Life-History of a Typical Ascidian.</b></p>

  <p>The eggs of Tunicata are for the most part of small size, nearly colourless and transparent,
  and with little or no food-yolk. <span class="pagenum" id="page56"><span
  class="smaller">{56}</span></span>In some, however (such as some of the Cynthiidae, and some
  Compound Ascidians), the eggs are larger, more opaque, and have a fair amount of food-yolk. Ova of
  this type are not expelled from the body of the parent as ova, but are fertilised, and remain in
  the atrial cavity or in a special diverticulum thereof&mdash;the incubatory pouch&mdash;until they
  are far advanced in development; and usually leave the body as tailed larvae. In many species, the
  ova and spermatozoa mature at different times in the life-history, and so self-fertilisation is
  prevented. Some species (such as many Botryllidae and Distomatidae) are protogynous, the ova being
  produced and shed before the testes have matured, while other species (<i>Coelocormus huxleyi</i>)
  are protandrous, being male while young and female later. But there is no doubt that in other
  cases (e.g. <i>Ascidia mentula</i>) self-fertilisation is not only possible, but does take place.
  After maturation certain of the follicle-cells which invest the ovum in the ovary migrate into the
  egg and proliferate so as to form a layer in the superficial part of the egg, where they appear as
  the so-called "testa-cells" or "kalymmocytes" (Fig. 25, A, <i>t.c</i>). The remaining
  follicle-cells may form two or more layers, usually one of large cubical cells, which may become
  greatly vacuolated, next to the ovum, and an external flattened layer which is cast off when the
  egg escapes from the ovary.</p>

  <p>Segmentation is complete and results in the formation of a spherical blastula with a small
  segmentation-cavity (Fig. 25, C). The blastula grows larger and begins to differentiate.<a
  id="NtA_96" href="#Nt_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> There are slightly smaller cells which divide more
  rapidly at one end of this embryo, the future ectoderm, and slightly larger and more granular
  cells at the other, which become chiefly endoderm (hypoblast). Invagination of the larger cells
  then takes place (Fig. 25, D), resulting in the formation of a gastrula with an archenteron. The
  hypoblast cells lining the archenteron become columnar (<i>hy</i>). The curving and more rapid
  growth at the anterior end of the embryo narrow the primitively wide open blastopore, and carry it
  to the posterior end of the future dorsal surface (Fig. 25, E). The orientation of the body is now
  clear.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The embryo is elongated antero-posteriorly, the dorsal surface is flattened, and the blastopore
  indicates its posterior end. Around the blastopore the large ectoderm cells form a medullary
  plate, along which a groove (the medullary groove), runs forwards, bounded at the sides by
  medullary folds which meet behind the blastopore. Underneath the posterior part of the medullary
  groove certain of the hypoblast cells from the dorsal wall of the archenteron, in the median line,
  form a band extending forwards (Fig. 25, E, <i>ch</i>). This band separates off from the
  hypoblast, which closes in beneath it, and thus gives rise to the notochord (Fig. 25, F). The more
  lateral and posterior cells become mesoblast, and separate off as lateral plates, which show no
  trace of metameric segmentation (Fig. 25, G). The remainder of the archenteron <span
  class="pagenum" id="page58"><span class="smaller">{58}</span></span>becomes the branchial sac, and
  by further growth buds off the rest of the alimentary canal.</p>

  <p>The medullary groove now becomes converted into the closed neural canal by the growing up and
  arching inwards (Fig. 25, G, <i>n.c</i>) of the medullary folds, which unite with one another from
  behind forwards in such a way that the blastopore now opens from the enteron into the floor of the
  neural canal, forming the neurenteric passage (Fig. 25, F, <i>n.e.c</i>). For a time the anterior
  end of the neural canal remains open as a neuropore. By this time the posterior end is elongating
  to form a tail, and the embryo is acquiring the tadpole-shape (Fig. 25, H) characteristic of the
  free larva. The tail grows rapidly, curves round the body, and also undergoes torsion, so that its
  dorsal surface comes to lie on the left side. It contains ectoderm cells on its surface,
  notochordal cells (in single file) up the centre (see Fig. 25, H, <i>ch</i>), a neural canal
  dorsally, and a row of endoderm cells representing the enteron ventrally to the notochord. Later
  on the mesoblast also is prolonged into the tail, where it forms a band of striated muscle-cells
  at each side of the notochord. When the ectoderm cells begin to secrete the cuticular test this
  forms two delicate transparent longitudinal (dorsal and ventral) fins in the tail (Fig. 25, K,
  <i>f</i>), and especially at its extremity where radial thickenings form striae resembling
  fin-rays. The ectoderm on the anterior end of the body grows out into three adhering papillae
  (Fig. 26, A).</p>

  <p>The neural canal now differentiates into a tubular dorsal nervous system. The anterior end
  dilates to form the thin-walled cerebral vesicle (see Figs. 25, I, and 26, A), containing later
  the intra-cerebral, dorsal, pigmented eye (<i>oc</i>), and the ventral otolith (<i>au</i>) of the
  larva. The next part of the canal thickens to form the trunk-ganglion, and behind that is the more
  slender "spinal cord," which runs to the extremity of the tail. A ciliated diverticulum of the
  anterior end of the enteric cavity (future pharynx) which enters into close relations with the
  front of the cerebral vesicle,<a id="NtA_97" href="#Nt_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> and later opens
  into the ectodermic invagination which forms the mouth at that spot, is evidently the rudiment of
  the neural duct or hypophysial canal. The future branchial sac (pharynx), with a ventral median
  thickening which will be the endostyle, is by this time clearly distinguishable by its large size
  <span class="pagenum" id="page59"><span class="smaller">{59}</span></span>from the much narrower
  posterior part of the enteron, which grows out to become the oesophagus, stomach, and intestine.
  The notochord does not extend forward into the pharyngeal region, but is confined to the posterior
  or caudal part of the embryo. It now shows lenticular pieces of a gelatinous intercellular
  substance secreted by the cells and lying between them (Fig. 25, I). The mouth forms as a
  stomodaeum, or ectodermal invagination, antero-dorsally in the region where the neuropore has
  closed, and about the same time two lateral ectodermal involutions form (Fig. 26, A, <i>at</i>),
  which become the atrial or peribranchial pouches, at first distinct, afterwards united in the
  mid-dorsal line to form the adult cloaca and atrial aperture. Ingrowths from the atrial pouches
  and outgrowths from the wall of the pharynx coalesce to form the proto-stigmata (primary
  gill-slits) by which the cavity of the branchial sac is first placed in communication with the
  exterior through the atrial apertures. Opinions differ as to whether only one or a few pairs of
  true gill-clefts are represented in the young Ascidian; and the actual details of their formation
  and subdivision, to form the stigmata of the adult, differ considerably in different forms. In
  <i>Clavelina</i> the stigmata are formed as independent perforations of the pharyngeal wall; in
  <i>Ascidia</i> two pairs of protostigmata increase to six pairs, which are subdivided into
  stigmata; <i>Botryllus</i> and other forms are intermediate in some respects. No doubt the
  subdivision of proto-stigmata is primitive, but has been lost from the ontogeny in some cases. To
  what precise extent the walls of the atrial or peribranchial cavities are formed of ectoderm, or
  of endoderm, is still doubtful.</p>

  <p>The embryo is hatched about two or three days after fertilisation, as a larva or Ascidian
  tadpole (Fig. 26, A) which leads a free-swimming existence for a short time, during which it
  develops its nervous system and cerebral sense-organs, and the powerful mesoblastic muscle-bands
  lying at the sides of the notochord (now a cylindrical rod of gelatinous nature surrounded by the
  remains of the original cells) in the tail which form the locomotory apparatus. Fig. 26, A, shows
  this stage, the highest in its chordate organisation, when the larva swims actively through the
  sea by vibrating its long tail with the dorsal and ventral fins.</p>

  <p>In addition to the structures already mentioned, the mesoderm <span class="pagenum"
  id="page60"><span class="smaller">{60}</span></span>has formed the beginning of the muscular
  body-wall, the connective tissue around the organs, and the blood; the endostyle has developed as
  a thick-walled groove along the ventral edge of the pharynx, which has become the branchial sac;
  and the pericardial sac and its invagination the heart have formed in the mesoblast between the
  endostyle and stomach. The "epicardiac tubes" grow out from the posterior end of the endostyle to
  join the pericardium. They play an important part in the formation of buds in the colonial
  Tunicata. The heart acquires a connexion with blastocoelic blood-spaces at its two ends. The heart
  and pericardium show the same relations in Tunicata as in Enteropneusta, but it is very doubtful
  whether these organs are genetically related to the Vertebrate heart.</p>

  <p>The unpaired optic organ in the cerebral vesicle when fully formed has a retina, pigment layer,
  lens and cornea; while the ventral median organ is a large, spherical, partially-pigmented otolith
  attached by delicate hair-like processes to the summit of a hollow "crista acustica" (Fig. 26, A).
  After a few hours, or at most a day or so, the larva attaches itself <span class="pagenum"
  id="page61"><span class="smaller">{61}</span></span>by one or more of the three anterior
  ectodermal glandular papillae (one dorsal and two lateral) to some foreign body, and commences the
  retrogressive metamorphosis which leads to the adult state. The adhering papillae, having
  performed their function, begin to atrophy, and their place is taken by the rapidly increasing
  test. The tail which at first vibrates rapidly is partly withdrawn from the test and absorbed, and
  partly cast off in shreds (Fig. 26, B, C, D). The notochord, nerve-tube, muscles, etc., are
  withdrawn into the body, where they break down and are absorbed by phagocytes. The posterior part
  of the nerve cord and its anterior end with the large sense-organs disappear, and the middle part
  or trunk-ganglion is reduced to form the relatively small ganglion of the adult, underneath which
  the hypophysial tube gives rise to the neural gland. While the locomotory, nervous and sensory
  organs are thus disappearing, or being reduced, the alimentary canal and reproductive viscera are
  growing largely. The branchial sac enlarges, its walls become penetrated by blood-channels, and
  grow out to form bars and papillae, and the number of openings greatly increases by the primary
  gill-slits being broken up into the transverse rows of stigmata. The stomach and intestine, which
  developed as an outgrowth from the back of the branchial sac at the right side, become longer and
  curve, so that the end of the intestine acquires an opening into at first the left hand side, and
  eventually the cloacal or median part of the atrial cavity. The adhering papillae have now
  disappeared, and are replaced functionally by a growth of the test over neighbouring objects; and
  at the same time the region of the body between the point of fixation and the mouth (branchial
  aperture) increases rapidly in extent, so as to cause the body of the Ascidian to rotate through
  about 180&deg;, and thus the branchial siphon is carried to the opposite end from the area of
  attachment (see Fig. 26, B, C, D, E). Finally the gonads and their ducts form in the mesoderm
  between the stomach and intestine. We thus reach the sedentary degenerate fixed adult Ascidian
  with little or no trace of the Chordate characteristics so marked in the earlier larval stage (see
  E and A, Fig. 26). The free-swimming tailed larva shows the Ascidian at the highest level of its
  organisation, and is the stage that indicates the genetic relationship of the Tunicata with the
  Vertebrata.</p>

  <p>In some Ascidians with more food-yolk in the egg, or in which <span class="pagenum"
  id="page62"><span class="smaller">{62}</span></span>the development takes place within the body of
  the parent, the life-history as given above is more or less modified and abbreviated, and in some
  few forms the tailed larval stage is missing. Some exceptional cases of development will be noted
  below under the groups to which they belong.</p>

  <p>The remarkable life-history of the typical Ascidian, of which the outlines are given above, is
  of importance from two points of view<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. It is an excellent example of degeneration. The free-swimming larva is a more highly
  developed animal than the adult Ascidian. The larva is, as we have seen, comparable with a larval
  fish or a young tadpole, and is thus a Chordate animal showing evident relationship to the
  Vertebrata; while the adult is in its structure non-Chordate, and is <i>on a level</i> with some
  of the worms, or with the lower Mollusca, in its organisation, although of an entirely different
  type.</p>

  <p class="sp5">2. It shows us the true position of the Ascidians (Tunicata) in the animal series.
  If we knew only the adult forms we might regard them as being an aberrant group of Worms, or
  possibly as occupying a position between worms and the lower Mollusca, or we might place them as
  an independent group; but we should certainly have to class them as Invertebrate animals. But when
  we know the whole life-history, and consider it in the light of "recapitulation" and
  "evolutionary" views we recognise that the Ascidians are evidently related to the Vertebrata, and
  were at one time free-swimming Chordata occupying a position somewhere below the lowest
  Fishes.</p>

  <p class="ac">CLASS TUNICATA.</p>

  <p>The Tunicata or Urochordata are hermaphrodite marine Chordate animals, which show in their
  development the essential Vertebrate characters, but in which the notochord is restricted to the
  posterior part of the body, and is in most cases present only during the free-swimming larval
  stages. The adult animals are usually sessile and degenerate, and may be either solitary or
  colonial, fixed or free. The nervous system is, in the larva, of the elongated, tubular, dorsal,
  Vertebrate type, but in most cases it degenerates in the adult to form a small ganglion placed
  above the pharynx. The body is completely covered with a thick cuticular test ("tunic") which
  contains a substance similar to cellulose. The alimentary canal has a greatly enlarged respiratory
  pharynx or branchial sac, which is perforated by two or many more or less modified gill-slits
  opening into a peribranchial or atrial cavity, which communicates with the exterior by a single
  dorsal exhalent aperture (rarely <span class="pagenum" id="page64"><span
  class="smaller">{64}</span></span>two ventral apertures). The ventral heart is simple and tubular,

  </div>

  <p class="sp3">This Class is divided into three Orders:&mdash;The Appendicularians, the Ascidians,
  and the Salpians (see Fig. 27).</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order I. Larvacea (Appendicularians).</b></p>

  <p>Free-swimming pelagic forms, in which the posterior part of the body takes the form of a large
  locomotory appendage, the <span class="pagenum" id="page65"><span
  class="smaller">{65}</span></span>"tail," in which there is a skeletal axis, the urochord. A
  relatively large cuticular test, the "house," may be formed with great rapidity (in an hour or so)
  as a secretion from a part of the ectoderm; it is, however, merely a temporary structure which is
  soon cast off and replaced by another. The branchial sac is simply an enlarged pharynx with two
  ventral ciliated openings (stigmata) leading to the exterior. These may be regarded as the
  representatives of the primary gill-slits (undivided) of the Ascidian. There are thus a single
  pair. There is no separate peribranchial, atrial, or cloacal cavity. The nervous system consists
  of a large dorsally placed ganglion and a long nerve-cord, which stretches backwards over the
  alimentary canal to reach the tail, along which it runs on the left side (morphological dorsal
  edge) of the urochord. The anus opens ventrally on the surface of the body, usually in front of
  the stigmata. No reproduction by gemmation or metamorphosis is known in the life-history.</p>

  <p><b>Structure and Mode of Life.</b>&mdash;This is one of the most interesting groups of the
  Tunicata, as it shows more completely than any of the rest the probable characters of the
  ancestral forms. It has undergone little or no degeneration, and consequently corresponds more
  nearly to the tailed, larval condition than to the adult forms of the other groups. It retains, in
  fact, the originally posterior, chordate, part of the body which is lost in the metamorphosis of
  all the other Tunicata. Hence the Appendicularians have been described as permanent, or sexually
  mature, larval forms, and hence also the adult <i>Ascidia</i> may be said to correspond to the
  trunk alone of the Appendicularian. The Order includes a single group, the <span
  class="sc">Appendiculariida</span>, all the members of which are minute (usually about 5 mm. in
  total length) and free-swimming (Fig. 28). They occur near the surface of the sea (and
  exceptionally in deeper water) in most parts of the world, moving in a characteristic vibratory
  manner by the contractions of the powerful tail (see Fig. 27). They possess the power of forming
  with great rapidity, from tracts of specially large glandular ectoderm cells, the "oikoplasts," an
  enormously large (many times the size of the body) investing gelatinous layer, which probably
  corresponds to the test of other groups, although it is doubtful whether it contains cellulose,
  and it differs also in having no immigrated cells and in its temporary nature. This structure
  (Fig. 28) was first described by Von <span class="pagenum" id="page66"><span
  class="smaller">{66}</span></span>Mertens, and by him named "Haus"; it has recently been more
  minutely investigated by Lohmann. It is only loosely attached to the body, and is frequently
  thrown off soon after its formation. Its function is probably protective, and possibly to some
  extent hydrostatic, and it may also be of use in straining the nutritive particles from the large
  volumes of water which filter through its complicated passages and perforated folds.<a id="NtA_98"
  href="#Nt_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> The long, laterally compressed "tail" in the Appendiculariida is
  attached to the ventral surface of the body (Fig. 30), and is bent downwards and forwards, so that
  it usually points more or less anteriorly; and is twisted through an angle of 90&deg;, so that the
  dorsal edge lies to the left. It shows what have been interpreted as traces of metameric
  segmentation, having its lateral muscle-bands broken up into successive pieces (supposed myotomes,
  probably only cells), while the nerve-cord presents a series of enlargements formed of groups of
  nerve-cells from which distributory nerves are given off. In <i>Oikopleura</i> the muscle-band in
  the tail is formed of ten cells fused on each side. Near the base of the tail there is a
  distinctly larger elongated ganglion. The urochord in the tail consists of a homogeneous rod
  surrounded by a sheath containing nuclei.</p>

  <p>The anterior (cerebral) ganglion has connected with it an otocyst (Fig. 29), a pigment spot,
  and a tubular richly ciliated process opening into the branchial sac, and representing the dorsal
  tubercle and associated parts of an ordinary Ascidian. The tube ends in a plain or coiled cellular
  mass lying to the right of the ganglion. No neural gland is found.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The branchial aperture or mouth leads into the simple branchial sac or pharynx (Fig. 30,
  <i>br.s</i>). There are no tentacles. The endostyle is short, is a closed tube both anteriorly and
  posteriorly (Fig. 29), and has about four longitudinal rows of gland-cells. There is no dorsal
  lamina, and the peripharyngeal bands run dorsally and posteriorly to unite close in front of the
  oesophageal opening. The wall of the branchial sac does not show the complex structure usual in
  Tunicata, and has only two ciliated apertures (Figs. 30, 31, 32, <i>sg</i>). These are homologous
  with the primary stigmata of the typical Ascidians, and with a pair of the gill-clefts of
  Vertebrates. They are placed far back on the ventral surface, one on each side of the middle line,
  and lead into short funnel-shaped tubes which open on the surface of the body behind the anus
  (Fig. 30, <i>at</i>). These tubes correspond to the right and left atrial involutions, which in an
  ordinary Ascidian fuse to form the peribranchial cavity. The remainder of the alimentary canal
  consists of oesophagus, stomach (which may have a glandular diverticulum), intestine and rectum
  (Fig. 30). The heart, surrounded ventrally by a delicate pericardial membrane, lies below and in
  front of the stomach, and is formed by the differentiation of the outer ends of epithelial cells
  into muscular fibrillae. Two specially large glandular cells are placed at the opposite ends of
  the heart. There are no blood-vessels except the remains of the primary body-cavity (blastocoel).
  No heart can be seen in some of the smaller species of <i>Oikopleura</i>. Nearly all the species
  are hermaphrodite, and the large ovary and testis are placed at the posterior end of the body.
  There is no proper oviduct, the genital <span class="pagenum" id="page68"><span
  class="smaller">{68}</span></span>products merely breaking through to the exterior at the point
  marked <i>g.d</i> in Fig. 30. The spermatozoa are generally matured and shed before the ova, and
  thus self-fertilisation is prevented. The ova are very small, and little is known of the
  development.</p>

  <p><b>Classification.</b>&mdash;There are two Families of Larvacea: First, the <span
  class="sc">Kowalevskiidae</span>, including only the remarkable genus <i>Kowalevskia</i>, Fol, in
  which the heart and endostyle are absent, and the branchial sac is provided with four rows of
  ciliated tooth-like processes. The two known species have been found in the Mediterranean and in
  the Atlantic.</p>

  <p>The second family <span class="sc">Appendiculariidae</span> comprises about eight genera,
  amongst which may be mentioned:&mdash;(1) <i>Oikopleura</i>, Mertens, and (2)
  <i>Appendicularia</i>, Fol, in both of which the body is short (1 or 2 mm. in length) and compact
  (Fig. 30), and the tail relatively long, while the endostyle is straight. (3) <i>Megalocercus</i>,
  Chun, from deep water in the Mediterranean; <i>M. abyssorum</i> is the largest Appendicularian
  known, having a total length of <span class="pagenum" id="page69"><span
  class="smaller">{69}</span></span>3 cm.&mdash;it is of a bright red colour. (4)
  <i>Fritillaria</i>, Q. and G., in which the body is elongated (Fig. 32) and composed of anterior
  and posterior regions, the tail relatively short, the endostyle recurved, the stigmata opening far
  in front of the anus, and an ectodermal hood is formed over the front of the body.</p>

  <p>In all nearly forty species of Larvacea are known.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Occurrence</b>.&mdash;Although for the most part transparent, and usually almost invisible
  in sea-water, some Appendicularians may have certain parts of the body (alimentary canal,
  endostyle, gonads, etc.) brilliantly pigmented (orange, violet, etc.), and may under exceptional
  circumstances be present in such profusion as to colour tracts of the sea. Appendicularians are
  widely distributed, having been found in all seas from the Arctic to the Antarctic, both round
  coasts and in the open ocean. Although a few species have been found at considerable depths in the
  Mediterranean, still in the Atlantic they are not deep-water animals, and as a group must be
  regarded as surface-forms. They are fairly abundant to a depth of 100 fathoms, and some few reach
  1500. Species of <i>Oikopleura</i> and <i>Fritillaria</i> are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page70"><span class="smaller">{70}</span></span>frequent round the British coasts, our
  commonest species being probably <i>O. dioica</i>, Fol, and <i>F. furcata</i>, Moss. Young
  specimens appear in the plankton about February and March, and larger forms are as a rule found
  later in the summer. Several instances have been recorded of swarms of especially large forms,
  provided with massive tests (the "house"), having appeared suddenly on our coast in such abundance
  as to form an important element in the surface life of the sea.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order II. Ascidiacea (Ascidians).</b></p>

  <p>Fixed or free-swimming Simple or Compound Ascidians, which in the adult are never provided with
  a locomotory appendage or tail, and have no trace of a notochord. The free-swimming forms are
  colonies, the Simple Ascidians being always sedentary and usually fixed. The test is permanent and
  well developed, and becomes organised by the immigration of cells from the body; as a rule it
  increases in size with the age of the individual. The branchial sac is large and well developed.
  Its walls are perforated by numerous slits (stigmata) opening into the peribranchial cavity, which
  communicates with the exterior by the single atrial aperture. Many of the Ascidiacea, both fixed
  and free, reproduce by gemmation to form colonies, and in most of them the sexually produced
  embryo develops into a tailed larva.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Ascidiacea includes three groups, the Simple Ascidians, the Compound Ascidians,
  and the free-swimming colonial <i>Pyrosoma</i>, which in some respects connects this Order with
  the Thaliacea.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page71"><span class="smaller">{71}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order 1. Ascidiae Simplices.</b></p>

  <p>Fixed Ascidians, which are solitary, and very rarely reproduce by gemmation; if, as in a few
  cases, small colonies are formed, the members are not buried in a common investing mass, but each
  has a distinct test of its own. No strict line of demarcation can be drawn between the Simple and
  Compound Ascidians; and one of the families of the former group, the Clavelinidae (the "Social"
  Ascidians of Milne-Edwards), forms a transition from the typical Simple forms which never
  reproduce by gemmation, to the Compound forms which always do. Over 500 species of Ascidiae
  Simplices are now known, but there are probably very many more still undescribed. The sub-order
  may be divided into the following families<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Clavelinidae.</b>&mdash;Simple Ascidians which reproduce by gemmation to form small
  colonies (Fig. 33), in which each member, or ascidiozooid, has a distinct test, but all are
  connected by a common blood-system, and by a prolongation of the "epicardiac tubes" (see <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page83">83</a></span>) from the branchial sac. Buds are formed on the
  stolons (Fig. 33), which are vascular outgrowths from the posterior end of the body, containing
  prolongations from the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm (the epicardium) of the Ascidiozooid.
  Branchial sac not folded; internal longitudinal bars usually absent; stigmata straight; tentacles
  simple. The Clavelinidae are the simplest of the Ascidiae Simplices. They are the forms that come
  nearest to the Compound Ascidians, and are closely related to the Distomatidae. They are probably
  the nearest representatives now existing of the ancestral forms from which both Simple and
  Compound Ascidians are descended.</p>

      (nat. size).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This family contains amongst others the following three genera:&mdash;<i>Ecteinascidia</i>,
  Herdman, with internal longitudinal bars in the branchial sac; <i>Clavelina</i>, Savigny, with a
  long body and intestine extending behind the branchial sac (Fig. 33); and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page72"><span class="smaller">{72}</span></span><i>Perophora</i>, Wiegmann, with a short
  compact body and intestine alongside the branchial sac. <i>Clavelina lepadiformis</i> and
  <i>Perophora listeri</i> are common British species found at a few fathoms depth off various parts
  of our coast. Both occur round the south end of the Isle of Man. In autumn <i>Clavelina</i>
  accumulates reserve-material in the ectoderm cells of parts of the stolon, which remain when the
  rest of the colony dies away, and then form new buds in spring.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Ascidiidae.</b>&mdash;Solitary fixed Ascidians, never forming colonies; with
  gelatinous or cartilaginous test; branchial aperture usually eight-lobed, atrial aperture usually
  six-lobed; branchial sac not folded; internal longitudinal bars usually present; stigmata straight
  or curved; tentacles simple; gonads in or around the intestinal loop. This family is divided into
  three sections<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 1. Hypobythiinae.</b>&mdash;Branchial sac with no internal longitudinal bars, test
  strengthened with curious symmetrically placed nodules.</p>

  <p>The one genus <i>Hypobythius</i>, Moseley, contains two stalked deep-water forms found by the
  "Challenger;" <i>H. calycodes</i> (Fig. 34, A), from the North Pacific, 2900 fathoms, and <i>H.

  detail above (Chapter II. <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page39">39</a></span>), and Figs. 15 to
  26 illustrate its structure and life-history. There are many species. <i>Ciona intestinalis</i>,
  Linn. (Fig. 40, B), is one of the commonest of British Ascidians, and lives readily in
  aquaria.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Fam. 3. Corellinae.</b>&mdash;Stigmata curved and forming spirals (Fig. 35). Three
  genera:&mdash;<i>Corella</i>, Alder and Hancock, test gelatinous, body sessile;
  <i>Corynascidia</i>, Herdman, test gelatinous, body pedunculated (Fig. 34, C), a remarkable
  deep-sea form with very delicate spirally-coiled vessels in the branchial sac (Fig. 35, A), found
  in the Pacific (2160 faths.) and the Southern Ocean; <i>Chelyosoma</i>, Brod. and Sowb., upper

  <p><i>Corella</i> contains several British species, one of which, <i>C. parallelogramma</i>, O. F.
  M&uuml;ll., is one of the commonest and most handsome Ascidians in our coralline zone (about 20
  faths.). Through its clear crystalline test the lemon-yellow and carmine pigmentation of the
  mantle, and even (with a lens) the working of the cilia along the spiral stigmata of the branchial
  sac (compare Fig. 35, B), can readily be seen. The beating of the heart can be seen just in front
  of the viscera upon the <i>right</i> side of the branchial sac (compare with <i>Ascidia</i>, Fig.
  23).</p>

  <p>In the family Ascidiidae the eggs are minute and contain <span class="pagenum"
  id="page74"><span class="smaller">{74}</span></span>little or no food-yolk, and the tailed larvae
  (Figs. 26, 42, A) are of the typical form and structure described in Chapter II.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Cynthiidae.</b>&mdash;Solitary fixed Ascidians (Fig. 39), sometimes occurring in
  aggregations, but never forming colonies; usually with leathery or fibrous, opaque test, which is
  sometimes encrusted with sand; branchial and atrial apertures usually both four-lobed. Branchial
  sac longitudinally folded (Fig. 36, A); stigmata straight; tentacles simple or compound (Fig. 37);

  Macleay, and <i>Polycarpa</i>, Heller (Fig. 39), with stigmata normal; and <i>Bathyoncus</i>,
  Herdman, with stigmata absent or modified. There are a very large number of species of both
  <i>Styela</i> and <i>Polycarpa</i> from all parts of the world, including our own seas. A very
  abundant British littoral form has been placed in an allied genus under the name <i>Styelopsis
  grossularia</i> (Fig. 39, A). It is known in some places round our coasts as "the red-currant
  squirter." This species has only one well-marked fold in the branchial sac (Fig. 36, C). Another
  exceptional British Styelid is <i>Pelonaia corrugata</i>, Forb. and Goods. (Fig. 39, I), with no
  branchial folds (Fig. 36, D).</p>

  richly coloured&mdash;reds, yellows and rich browns predominating&mdash;and so look very different
  to the grey gelatinous Ascidiidae, and to the sand-encrusted Molgulidae. They extend from between
  tide-marks (<i>Styelopsis grossularia</i>), down to the abysses (<i>Styela bythia</i> and <i>S.

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Molgulidae.</b>&mdash;Solitary sessile Ascidians, sometimes not fixed; branchial
  aperture six-lobed, atrial four-lobed. Test usually encrusted with sand, which is generally
  attached to branched hair-like processes from the test (Fig. 40, C). Branchial sac longitudinally

  <span class="pagenum" id="page78"><span class="smaller">{78}</span></span>(genus <i>Anurella</i>,
  Lacaze-Duthiers), the embryo does not become converted into a tailed larva, the development being
  direct without metamorphosis (see Fig. 42, C). The embryo when hatched gradually assumes the adult
  structure, and never shows the features characteristic of larval Ascidians, such as the urochord
  and the median sense-organs. Fig. 42 shows an Ascidiid (A), a Cynthiid (B), and this exceptional

  </div>

  <p>In the Molgulidae the viscera are characteristic in position and appearance. The alimentary
  canal lies on the left side of the branchial sac, and the intestine forms a long narrow loop
  directed in the main transversely. The pericardium and heart are on the middle of the right side,
  and behind them is placed the single sac-like ductless renal organ, generally occupied by one or
  more concretions. The gonads are in most cases on both sides of the body, in front of the
  intestine on the left, and in front of the heart on the right; but in <i>Eugyra</i> there is no
  gonad on the right side, and in some other forms the gonad on the left side is absent. (For
  <i>Oligotrema</i>, see <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page111">111</a></span>, note.)</p>

  <p>There are a number of British Molgulidae, the two commonest <span class="pagenum"
  id="page79"><span class="smaller">{79}</span></span>of which are&mdash;<i>Molgula oculata</i>,
  Forbes, thickly covered with gravel or broken shells, and forming an ovate mass as large as a
  walnut; and <i>Eugyra glutinans</i>, M&ouml;ller, a smaller more globular body, the size of an acorn,
  and covered with fine sand, except at one circular area near the posterior end, where the leaden
  grey test shows through. Both these species are obtained by dredging in from 10 to 30 fathoms, and
  lie freely on the bottom. A rather rarer littoral species <i>Molgula citrina</i>, Hancock, found
  on some parts of our coast (<i>e.g.</i> in the Firth of Forth, at Arran, and at Port Erin), is
  exceptional in having the test free from sand, and in being fixed like an <i>Ascidia</i>,
  generally to the lower surfaces of large stones near low tide.</p>

  <p><b>Specific Characters and Dorsal Tubercle.</b>&mdash;The chief points in which the various
  genera and species of Simple Ascidians differ are the details of the branchial sac (see Figs. 22,
  35, 36, 38, and 41), the condition of the tentacles (Fig. 37), the dorsal lamina or languets, and
  the dorsal tubercle, in addition to form, colour, and other external features.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Fig. 43 shows some of the more remarkable forms of dorsal tubercle. Starting with a simple
  circular opening (1) surrounded by a thickened ciliated ring, the anterior border becomes pushed
  in to form a crescentic slit (2 and 3). The horns of the crescent then grow longer and may be
  turned in (4 and 5) or out (6 and 7), and so give rise to the many varieties of horse-shoe (such
  as 6), perhaps the commonest form of dorsal tubercle in Simple Ascidians. In many Cynthiidae the
  central part of the <span class="pagenum" id="page80"><span
  class="smaller">{80}</span></span>horse-shoe remains small, while the horns become long and much
  coiled so as to constitute two prominent spirals (8, 9, 10). In other exceptional forms again the
  curved slit becomes straightened out, undulating (11), irregularly bent (12 and 13), elaborately
  folded (14 and 15), or broken up into pieces (16), so that there come to be several or even a
  large number (17 and 18) of minute openings in place of the original single aperture.</p>

  <p class="sp3">It cannot be said that any form of dorsal tubercle is characteristic of any of the
  families or genera of Ascidians, and in the case of some species the organ is liable to great
  individual variation; but still in most species there is found to be a characteristic shape or
  appearance of tubercle which is a useful diagnostic feature.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order 2. Ascidiae Compositae.</b></p>

  <p>Fixed Ascidians which reproduce by gemmation so as to form colonies (Fig. 44) in which the
  ascidiozooids are buried in a common investing mass (Fig. 45) and have no separate

  <p>This is probably a somewhat artificial assemblage formed of those two or three groups of
  Ascidians which produce colonies, in which the ascidiozooids are so intimately united that they
  possess a common test or investing mass. This is the only character which distinguishes them from
  the Clavelinidae, but the property of reproducing by gemmation separates them from the rest of the
  Ascidiae Simplices. In some cases the atrial apertures of several neighbouring ascidiozooids join
  to open to the exterior by a common cloacal aperture (Fig. 45, <i>c.c</i>). Such <span
  class="pagenum" id="page81"><span class="smaller">{81}</span></span>groups of the ascidiozooids of
  a colony are known as "systems" or coenobia (see Fig. 44, D; also Fig. 53, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page89">89</a></span>).</p>

  <p>The Ascidiae Compositae may be divided into seven families, which seem to fall into two
  well-marked sets:&mdash;(1) <span class="sc">Merosomata</span>, in which the heart and alimentary
  and reproductive viscera are placed behind the branchial sac, so as to constitute a more or less
  extended body divided into at least two regions (Fig. 46, B), and sometimes three (Fig. 46,
  C)&mdash;thorax, abdomen, and post-abdomen; and (2) <span class="sc">Holosomata</span>, in which
  the body of the ascidiozooid is short, compact, and not divided into regions (Fig. 46, A). The
  latter group comprises the two families Botryllidae and Polystyelidae, which agree both in points
  of structure and in having the same type of budding, and are probably derived from ancestral
  Cynthiidae amongst Simple Ascidians; while the Merosomata seem more nearly related to the
  Clavelinidae.</p>

  <p><b>Gemmation</b> takes place in the Compound Ascidians in a variety of ways, being sometimes
  very different in its details in closely allied forms. There are, however, two main types of
  budding, to one or other of which most of the described methods may be referred. These are<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. The <span class="sc">Stolonial</span>, or "epicardiac" type&mdash;seen in the Merosomata,
  typically in Distomatidae and Polyclinidae, and comparable with the gemmation in Clavelinidae,
  Pyrosomatidae, and Thaliacea outside this group.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page82"><span class="smaller">{82}</span></span></div>

  <p>2. The <span class="sc">Parietal</span>, or "peribranchial" type&mdash;seen in the Holosomata,
  typically in the Botryllidae.</p>

  <p>The remarkable process of gemmation seen in the families Didemnidae and Diplosomatidae, where
  the bud arises from at least two rudiments, the one stolonial or epicardiac in origin, and the
  other formed by one or more oesophageal or intestinal outgrowths, has been called
  "entero-epicardiac," but it may probably be regarded as a modification of the stolonial type.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The marked differences in the appearance of the colonies of Compound Ascidians is largely due
  to the methods of budding; and even in those of the stolonial type, where the budding is
  practically the same in essential nature, the results may be very different in superficial
  appearance, according as the buds are <span class="pagenum" id="page83"><span
  class="smaller">{83}</span></span>formed on a short stolon close to the parent body, or from the
  extremity of the post-abdomen (as in the Polyclinidae), or from a long epicardiac tube (as in
  <i>Colella</i>, Fig. 47), which may extend for some inches from the ascidiozooid. The post-abdomen
  of the Polyclinidae may be regarded as a stolon invaded by the gonads and the heart (see Fig. 46,
  C), and traversed by the epicardium in the form of a flattened tube dividing a dorsal blood-sinus
  containing the gonads from a ventral sinus which has merely the one extremity of the tapering
  pericardium. The whole of this post-abdomen segments to form the buds, the heart at the extremity
  being absorbed, and a new one formed from the anterior end of the pericardium.</p>

  <p>The epicardium, which supplies the endodermal element to each bud, was first described by E.
  van Beneden and Julin in the envelopment of <i>Clavelina</i>,<a id="NtA_99"
  href="#Nt_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a> as a structure concerned in the formation of the pericardium and
  heart&mdash;hence its unfortunate name. It grows backwards in the larva, from the posterior wall
  of the branchial sac, close to the endostyle, as a tube which usually divides into two lateral
  branches to be united again eventually so as to form the single tubular flattened partition of the
  stolon in Polyclinidae, Distomatidae, Clavelinidae, etc. In some Compound Ascidians the epicardium
  is, from its origin, two distinct lateral tubes, which grow back from the inner vesicle of the
  embryo (later the branchial sac). These unite in the post-abdomen to form the flattened tube,
  which in its turn forms the inner vesicle of the future buds, and so the endodermal element is
  handed on from generation to generation. In addition to the epicardium, the stolon contains also a
  prolongation of the ovary of the parent, or at least a string of migrating germ cells, so that the
  reproductive elements are also handed on.</p>

  <p>It is clear from the recent researches of Hjort, Ritter, Lefevre,<a id="NtA_100"
  href="#Nt_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> and others, that the development of the bud (blastozooid) and
  that of the embryo (oozooid) do not proceed along parallel lines. It is evidently impossible to
  harmonise the facts of gemmation with the germ-layer theory; and attempts to explain budding in
  Ascidians solely as a process of regeneration by which the organs of the parent or their
  germ-layers give rise to the corresponding organs in the bud have in many cases failed.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page84"><span class="smaller">{84}</span></span></div>

  <p>The rudiment of the bud is in typical cases composed of two vesicles, an outer derived from the
  ectoderm of the parent and enclosing free blood-cells (mesodermal) between its wall and that of
  the inner vesicle&mdash;which is usually of endodermal origin, but in Botryllidae is derived from
  the peribranchial sac, an ectodermal structure. The inner vesicle, derived in the two cases from
  different germ-layers, forms the same organs of the bud, and these organs may be of widely
  different origin in the larva. Moreover, free cells of the blood may play in the bud a very
  important part, and give rise (<i>Perophora</i>) to such important systems as pericardium and
  heart, neural tube and ganglion, the gonads and their ducts, some of which are of ectodermal and
  others of endodermal origin in the larva.</p>

  <p>In some cases of precocious budding (blastogenetic acceleration) the young buds begin to appear
  during the tailed larval stage. The larva may even contain a first blastozooid (bud) with a
  branchial sac as large as that of the oozooid (derived from the egg); and in the Diplosomatidae
  the larva (see Fig. 42, F), when it settles down, may be already a small colony of three young
  ascidiozooids.</p>

  <p>The larvae in most Compound Ascidians, in place of adhering papillae, have several or even a
  considerable number of ectodermal tubes or prolongations from the body (see Fig. 42, E and F) into
  the surrounding test. These apparently aid in the formation of the common test of the young
  colony, which grows over and adheres to foreign objects.</p>

  <p>There are many irregularities in the larval development of Compound Ascidians, due to the very
  different amount of food-yolk present in the ova in different genera. In some cases there is even
  dimorphism, two forms of larvae being found in the same colony.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Compound Ascidians are amongst the most varied and brilliant of sessile animals
  seen at low tide on our own and most other coasts. Some are stalked and form club-shaped or
  knob-like outgrowths. Others again form flat gelatinous expansions attached to sea-weeds or
  stones, and are symmetrically marked with bright spots of colour in the form of circles,
  meandering lines, or star-like patterns. In such colonies each spot of colour or ray of a star
  represents an ascidiozooid or member of the colony, equivalent to the whole animal in the case of
  the solitary Simple Ascidian.</p>

  as Bancroft<a id="NtA_101" href="#Nt_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> has recently shown, with the end of
  the oviduct (see Fig. 47, B). In these pouches the embryos undergo their development, and are set
  free by the decay of the top of the colony. The stolons pass from the ascidiozooids in the upper
  part of the colony down into the stalk, and there produce buds which gradually work up to the top
  of the stalk, where they take their places as young ascidiozooids. At the top of the colony the
  old ascidiozooids die and are removed (see Fig. 47, A). Caullery has shown that in <span
  class="pagenum" id="page86"><span class="smaller">{86}</span></span>this genus there may be
  dimorphism in the buds, some of them placed deeply in the stalk having a large amount of reserve
  food-matter in their ectoderm, and remaining dormant until required to regenerate the "head" or
  upper part of the colony when it is lost. This genus was made known by the "Challenger"
  expedition. The species are mostly tropical, or from southern seas.</p>

  of the colony these vessels end in knob-like dilatations, the ampullae (Fig. 46, A, <i>t.k</i>),
  which are said by Bancroft to pulsate rhythmically, and so aid in keeping up the colonial
  circulation. They are also storage reservoirs for the blood, doubtless help in respiration, and

  Ascidians.</p>

  <p><b>Budding in Holosomata</b>&mdash;In the Polystyelidae, according to Ritter,<a id="NtA_102"
  href="#Nt_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> the budding is of the same type as in Botryllidae, the bud
  arising in each case from the lateral body-wall of the parent.</p>

  <p>In <i>Botryllus</i><a id="NtA_103" href="#Nt_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> the oozooid formed from
  the larva gives rise at a very early period to the first blastozooid of the future colony. This
  then forms the two buds of the second generation on its sides (see Fig. 55), and these in their
  turn form the third, and these the fourth generation, in which there are thus eight blastozooids;
  and so the process goes on, the buds of each generation arranging themselves in a circle to form a
  system. As each new generation makes its appearance, the preceding one undergoes degeneration, and
  is eventually absorbed. Consequently, in a system there can usually be seen, in addition to the
  adult members, certain older ones in various stages of degeneration and removal, and certain
  younger ones arising as buds on the sides of their predecessors, or just separated from them, and
  ready to take their places as young ascidiozooids in the system. Three distinct generations are
  thus commonly seen in a system. Now and again one or two young ascidiozooids become squeezed by
  the pressure of their neighbours out of a system into the surrounding test, and so give rise to
  new systems which add to the extent of the colony.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order 3. Ascidiae Luciae.</b></p>

  <p>Free-swimming pelagic colonies having the form of a hollow cylinder closed at one end (Fig.
  56). The ascidiozooids forming the colony are imbedded in the common test in such a manner that
  the branchial apertures open on the outer surface and the <span class="pagenum" id="page91"><span
  class="smaller">{91}</span></span>atrial apertures on the inner surface next to the central cavity
  of the colony. They are placed with their ventral surfaces towards the closed end (Fig. 56, C).
  The first ascidiozooids of a colony are produced by gemmation from a stolonic prolongation of an
  imperfect oozooid or rudimentary larva (the "cyathozooid"), developed sexually. The subsequent
  ascidiozooids are formed from these as buds on a ventral stolon.</p>

  <p>This sub-order includes a single family, the <span class="sc">Pyrosomatidae</span>, containing
  one well-marked genus <i>Pyrosoma</i>, P&eacute;ron, with about six species. They are found swimming near
  the surface of the sea, chiefly in tropical latitudes, and are brilliantly phosphorescent. A fully
  developed <i>Pyrosoma</i> colony may be from an inch or two to upwards of twelve feet in
  length.</p>

  <p><b>The Colony.</b>&mdash;The shape of the colony is seen in Fig. 56, A. It tapers slightly
  towards the closed end, which is rounded. The opening at the opposite end may be reduced in size
  (see B and C), by the presence of a membranous prolongation of the common test, which can be
  contracted or expanded by means of the muscle-bands it receives from the atrial siphons of
  neighbouring zooids. The branchial apertures of the ascidiozooids are mostly placed upon short (in
  some cases longer) papillae projecting from the general surface, and many of the ascidiozooids
  have long conical processes of the test extending outwards beyond their branchial <span
  class="pagenum" id="page92"><span class="smaller">{92}</span></span>apertures (Fig. 57,
  <i>t&prime;</i>). There is only a single layer of adult ascidiozooids in the wall of the
  <i>Pyrosoma</i> colony, as all the fully developed ascidiozooids are placed with their
  antero-posterior axes at right angles to the surface and communicate by their atrial apertures
  with the central cavity (Fig. 56, C). Their dorsal surfaces are turned towards the open end of the
  colony, and the buds are given off from their ventral edges (Fig. 57).</p>

  <p><b>Anatomy.</b>&mdash;The more important points in the structure of the ascidiozooid of
  <i>Pyrosoma</i> are shown in Fig. 57. A circle of tentacles, of which one, placed ventrally
  (<i>tn</i>), is larger than the rest, is found just inside the circular branchial aperture. From
  this point a wide cavity, with a few circularly placed muscle-bands running round its walls, leads
  back to the large branchial sac (<i>br.s.</i>), which occupies the greater part of the body. The
  large stigmata are elongated transversely (dorso-ventrally), and are crossed by internal
  longitudinal bars running antero-posteriorly. The dorsal lamina is represented by a series of
  eight or ten <span class="pagenum" id="page93"><span class="smaller">{93}</span></span>languets.
  The nerve-ganglion (on which is placed a small pigmented sense-organ, the unpaired "eye"), the
  neural gland, the dorsal tubercle, the peripharyngeal bands and the endostyle are placed in the
  usual positions. On each side of the anterior end of the branchial sac, close to the
  peripharyngeal bands is a mass of rounded mesodermal gland-cells (<i>l.o</i>), which are the
  source of the phosphorescence. They are apparently modified leucocytes lying in blood-sinuses. The
  alimentary canal is placed posteriorly to the branchial sac, and the anus opens into a large
  peribranchial or atrial cavity, of which only the median posterior part (<i>cl</i>), is shown in
  Fig. 57. The heart (<i>Ht</i>) lies between the posterior end of the branchial sac and the
  intestine, close to where the endostyle is prolonged outwards to form the inner tube of the
  ventral stolon. The reproductive organs are developed from a cord of germinal tissue which forms a
  part of every budding stolon, and so establishes a continuity of origin between the ova of
  successive generations of <i>Pyrosoma</i>. On the ventral edge of the body, immediately behind the
  stolon, with part of which it is continuous, a portion of this germinal tissue gives rise to a
  lobed testis (<i>tes</i>), and to a single ovum surrounded by indifferent or follicle-cells.</p>

  <p><b>Development and Life-History.</b>&mdash;The development takes place within the body of the
  parent, in a part of the peribranchial cavity. It is a "direct" development, the tailed larval
  stage being omitted. The segmentation is incomplete or "meroblastic," and an elongated embryo is
  formed on the surface of a mass of food-yolk. Follicle-cells, or kalymmocytes, migrate into the
  embryo, where they aid in its nutrition. The embryo (or young oozooid),<a id="NtA_104"
  href="#Nt_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a> after the formation of an alimentary cavity, a tubular nervous
  system, and a pair of laterally placed atrial tubes, divides into an anterior and a posterior part
  (see Fig. 58). The anterior and ventral part, or stolon, then segments into four pieces (the
  tetrazooids or first blastozooids),<a href="#Nt_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a> which afterwards develop
  into the first ascidiozooids of the colony, while the posterior part remains in a rudimentary
  condition, and is what was called by Huxley the "cyathozooid" (Fig. 58, <i>cy</i>). This is really
  the degenerate oozooid, and eventually atrophies without having <span class="pagenum"
  id="page94"><span class="smaller">{94}</span></span>completed its development, but having
  precociously given rise to the budding stolon.</p>

  <p>As the four ascidiozooids increase in size, they grow round the cyathozooid and soon encircle
  it (Fig. 58, B). In this condition the young colony leaves the body of the parent and becomes
  free. The cyathozooid absorbs the nourishing yolk upon which it lies, and distributes it to the
  ascidiozooids by means of a heart and system of vessels which have been meanwhile formed. When the
  cyathozooid atrophies and is absorbed, its original atrial aperture remains and deepens to become
  the central cavity<a id="NtA_105" href="#Nt_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a> of the young colony, which
  now consists of four ascidiozooids placed in a ring, around where the cyathozooid was, and
  enveloped in a common test. The test is at first formed by the ectoderm cells of the cyathozooid.
  Later it becomes invaded by mesoblast cells from the ascidiozooids in the usual manner. The colony
  gradually increases by the formation of buds from these four original ascidiozooids. The young
  colony is, in some species, at first male, and only becomes hermaphrodite when it has attained to
  some size.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Occurrence.</b>&mdash;The half-dozen known species of <i>Pyrosoma</i> are widely
  distributed over the great oceans, although they are probably most abundant in tropical waters.
  <i>Pyrosoma atlanticum</i>, P&eacute;ron, and <i>P. giganteum</i>, Lesueur, are the commonest forms.
  Although sometimes abundant in the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic they have apparently not
  been found in British seas. <i>P. elegans</i>, Lesueur, is a Mediterranean form allied to the last
  two; and <i>P. minatum</i> and <i>P. aherniosum</i>, Seeliger, were discovered during the German
  "Plankton" expedition in the tropical Atlantic. Finally, the enormous <i>P. spinosum</i>, Herdman,
  was found by the "Challenger" in both North and South Atlantic in 1873; and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page95"><span class="smaller">{95}</span></span>some years later (Perrier's <i>P.
  excelsior</i>) by the French "Talisman" expedition in the tropical Atlantic. The late Professor
  Moseley said of this ("Challenger") species, "I wrote my name with my finger on the surface of the
  giant <i>Pyrosoma</i> as it lay on deck in a tub at night, and my name came out in a few seconds
  in letters of fire." Bonnier and P&eacute;rez have recently recorded that they saw an enormous profusion
  of a large <i>Pyrosoma</i> (up to four metres in length) in the Arabian part of the Indian
  Ocean.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order III. Thaliacea (Salpians).</b></p>

  <p class="sp3">Free-swimming pelagic forms of moderate size, which may be either simple or
  compound, and in which the adult is never provided with a tail or notochord. Consequently the
  whole body here corresponds to the trunk only of the Appendicularian without the tail. The test is
  permanent, and may be either well developed or very slight. In all cases it is clear and
  transparent. The musculature of the body-wall is in the form of more or less complete circular
  bands, by the contraction of which water is ejected from the body, and so locomotion is effected.
  The branchial sac has either two large, or many small, stigmata, leading to a single peribranchial
  cavity, into which the anus also opens. Blastogenesis takes place from a ventral, endostylar
  stolon. Alternation of generations occurs in the life-history, and may be complicated by
  polymorphism. The Order Thaliacea comprises two groups, <span class="sc">Cyclomyaria</span> (such
  as <i>Doliolum</i>) and <span class="sc">Hemimyaria</span> (such as <i>Salpa</i>).</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order 1. Cyclomyaria.</b></p>

  <p>Free-swimming pelagic forms which exhibit alternation of generations in their life-history, but
  never form permanent colonies. The body is cask-shaped, with the branchial and atrial apertures at
  the opposite ends. The test is moderately well developed, never much thickened. The musculature is
  mostly in the form of complete circular bands surrounding the body. The branchial sac is fairly
  large, occupying the anterior half or more of the body. Stigmata are usually present in its
  posterior part only. The peribranchial cavity is mainly posterior to the branchial sac. The
  alimentary canal is placed ventrally, close to <span class="pagenum" id="page96"><span
  class="smaller">{96}</span></span>the posterior end of the branchial sac. Hermaphrodite
  reproductive organs lie ventrally near the intestine.</p>

  <p>This group is clearly distinguished from the second sub-order, the Hemimyaria, by the condition
  of the muscle-bands and of the branchial sac, and by the life-history. The muscle-bands are
  complete rings (except in <i>Anchinia</i>), while in the Hemimyaria they are always more or less
  incomplete. The branchial sac in the Cyclomyaria is a distinct cavity, and communicates with the
  peribranchial cavity only by small slits or stigmata. The life-history is also very
  characteristic, as the sexual generation in the Cyclomyaria is always polymorphic, while in the
  Hemimyaria it consists of one form only.</p>

  <p><b>Structure of Doliolum.</b>&mdash;The single family <span class="sc">Doliolidae</span>
  includes three genera, <i>Doliolum</i>, Quoy and Gaimard, <i>Dolchinia</i>, Korotneff, and
  <i>Anchinia</i>, Eschscholtz. <i>Doliolum</i>, of which about a dozen species are known, from
  various seas, has a cask-shaped body (Fig. 59), usually from 1 to 2 cm. in length. The terminal
  branchial and atrial apertures are lobed, and the lobes are provided with sense-organs. The test
  is a thin but tough transparent layer, and contains no "test" cells. It is merely a cuticle
  covering the surface of the squamous ectoderm. The body-wall has eight or nine circular
  muscle-bands surrounding the body. The most anterior and posterior of these form the branchial and
  atrial sphincters. The wide branchial and atrial apertures lead respectively into branchial and
  peribranchial cavities separated by the posterior and postero-lateral walls of the branchial sac
  which are pierced by a considerable number of <span class="pagenum" id="page97"><span
  class="smaller">{97}</span></span>small stigmata; consequently there is a free passage for the
  water through the body along its long axis, and the animal swims by contracting its ring-like
  muscle-bands so as to force out the contained water posteriorly. When stigmata are found on the
  lateral walls of the branchial sac (see Fig. 59) there are corresponding anteriorly directed
  diverticula of the peribranchial cavity. There is a distinct endostyle on the ventral edge of the
  branchial sac and a peripharyngeal band surrounding its anterior end, but there is no
  representative of the dorsal lamina along its dorsal edge; and there are neither branchial nor
  atrial tentacles. The oesophagus commences rather on the ventral edge of the posterior end of the
  branchial sac, and runs backwards to open into the stomach, which is followed by a curved
  intestine opening into the peribranchial cavity. The alimentary canal as a whole is to the right
  of the middle line. The hermaphrodite reproductive organs are to the left of the middle line
  alongside the alimentary canal. They open into the peribranchial cavity. The ovary is nearly
  spherical, while the testis is elongated, and may be continued anteriorly for a long distance. The
  heart is placed in the middle line ventrally, between the posterior end of the endostyle and the
  oesophageal aperture. The nerve-ganglion lies about the middle of the dorsal edge of the body, and
  gives off many nerves. Under it is placed the neural gland, the duct of which runs forward and
  opens into the anterior end of the branchial sac by a simple aperture surrounded by the spirally
  twisted dorsal ends of the peripharyngeal bands.</p>

  <p><b>Life-History.</b>&mdash;The ova produced by the <i>Doliolum</i> of the sexual generation,
  after a complete or "holoblastic" segmentation, and normal invagination, produce tailed larvae
  with a relatively small caudal appendage, and a large body in which the characteristic musculature
  begins to appear (Fig. 60, A). These larvae after metamorphosis lose their tails and develop into
  oozooids, known as "nurses," which are asexual, and are characterised (Fig. 60, B) by the
  possession of nine muscle-bands, by the stigmata being few in number and confined to the posterior
  end of the branchial sac, by an otocyst on the left side of the body, by a ventrally-placed
  complex stolon or "rosette organ" near the heart, from which primary buds are produced by
  constriction, and by a dorsal outgrowth ("the cadophore") near the posterior end of the body. The
  buds (blastozooids) give rise eventually, after <span class="pagenum" id="page98"><span
  class="smaller">{98}</span></span>further division, to the sexual generation, which is
  polymorphic&mdash;having three distinct forms, in two of which the reproductive organs remain
  undeveloped.</p>

      Uljanin and Barrois.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The primary buds are constricted off while still very young and undeveloped (Fig. 60, D, B, and
  E); they migrate from their place of origin on the stolon, over the surface (aided by large
  amoeboid test-cells which become attached to the buds) (Fig. 60, B), multiply by fission, and
  become attached (again by the help of amoeboid test-cells and ectoderm cells which form a slight
  "placenta") in three rows&mdash;a median and two lateral&mdash;to the dorsal outgrowth (Fig. 60,
  C) of the body of the nurse. This parent-form by this time has become greatly modified, and its
  structure is largely sacrificed for the good of the buds or growing zooids, for which it really
  forms a locomotory organ. Its muscle-bands become greatly developed in width (Fig. 60, C), and the
  branchial meshwork, endostyle, and alimentary canal disappear.</p>

  <p>The three forms produced in the second generation are as follows:&mdash;(1) Nutritive forms
  ("trophozooids") derived from the lateral rows of buds, which remain permanently attached to the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page99"><span class="smaller">{99}</span></span>oozooid, and are
  sacrificed for the benefit of the rest of the colony. They serve merely to aid in respiration, and
  to provide the food for the nurse and the median buds. Their development is arrested; they have
  the body elongated dorso-ventrally with a large funnel-like branchial aperture (Fig. 60, F), and
  the musculature is very slightly developed.</p>

  <p>(2) Some of the median buds become foster forms ("phorozooids"), which, like the preceding
  trophozooids, do not become sexually mature, but, unlike them, are eventually set free as
  cask-shaped bodies having the <i>Doliolum</i> appearance, with eight encircling muscle-bands, and
  having, moreover, a ventral outgrowth (not a stolon), which is formed of the stalk by which the
  body was formerly attached to the dorsal process of the oozooid. On this ventral outgrowth the
  "gonozooids" (3) are attached while still very young buds, and after the phorozooids are set free
  these reproductive forms gradually attain their complete development, become sexually mature, and
  are eventually separated off, finally losing all trace of their temporary connexion with the
  foster-forms. They resemble the foster-forms in having a cask-shaped body with eight muscle-bands,
  but differ in the absence of a ventral process, and in having the sexual reproductive organs fully
  developed.</p>

  <p><b>Occurrence.</b>&mdash;The best-known member of the genus is <i>Doliolum tritonis</i>,
  Herdman, which was captured in the tow-nets in thousands by Sir John Murray during the cruise of
  H.M.S. "Triton" in the summer of 1882 in the North Atlantic. Since then that species, or the
  closely allied <i>D. nationalis</i>, Borgert, have been found on more than one occasion in the
  English Channel and other parts of our south-west coast, and so <i>Doliolum</i> may be regarded as
  an occasional member of the British surface fauna.</p>

  <p>It is probable that the occasional phenomenal swarms of <i>Doliolum</i> which have been met
  with in summer in the North Atlantic are a result of the curious life-history which, under
  favourable circumstances, allows of a small number of oozooids producing from minute buds an
  enormous number of phorozooids and gonozooids.</p>

  <p>As the result of the careful quantitative work of the German "Plankton" expedition, Borgert
  thinks that the temperature of the water has more to do with both the horizontal and the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page100"><span class="smaller">{100}</span></span>vertical distribution of
  these Thaliacea in the sea than any other factor.</p>

  <p><b>Other Genera.</b>&mdash;<i>Anchinia</i>, of which only one species is known, <i>A.
  rubra</i>, Vogt, from the Mediterranean, has the sexual forms permanently attached to portions of
  the dorsal outgrowth from the body of the unknown oozooid ("nurse"). The stolon is probably much
  longer than in <i>Doliolum</i>, and curves round so as to reach and lie along the dorsal
  outgrowth, upon which it places the buds.</p>

  <p>The body of the adult is elongated dorso-ventrally. The test is well developed and contains
  branched cells. The musculature is not so well developed as in <i>Doliolum</i>. There are two
  circular bands at the anterior end, two at the posterior, and two muscles on the middle of the
  body, which unite to form the characteristic <span class="sans fwb">S</span>-shaped lateral bands.
  The stigmata are confined to the obliquely-placed posterior end of the branchial sac. The
  alimentary canal forms a <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped curve. The reproductive organs are
  placed on the right side of the body. The life-history is still imperfectly known. As in the case
  of <i>Doliolum</i> the sexual generation is polymorphic, and has three forms, two of which remain
  in a rudimentary condition so far as the reproductive organs are concerned. They are known as the
  first and second sterile forms, or "trophozooids." In <i>Anchinia</i>, however, the three forms do
  not occur, so far as we know, together at the same time on the one outgrowth, but are produced
  successively, or in different regions, the reproductive forms of the sexual generation being
  independent of the "foster-forms."<a id="NtA_106" href="#Nt_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="sp3">The third genus, <i>Dolchinia</i>, contains also only a single species, <i>D.
  mirabilis</i>, found by Korotneff<a id="NtA_107" href="#Nt_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a> in the Gulf
  of Naples. It must have three different forms in its life-history&mdash;oozooid, phorozooid, and
  gonozooid, but the first of these is still unknown. On what must be body processes detached from
  the oozooid are found phorozooids somewhat like those of <i>Doliolum</i>, bearing sexual forms
  attached to ventral stalks. <i>Dolchinia</i> is intermediate on the whole between <i>Anchinia</i>,
  the most simple member of the family, and <i>Doliolum</i> the most complex; and may eventually
  come to be united with the latter genus.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page101"><span class="smaller">{101}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order 2. Hemimyaria.</b></p>

  <p>Free-swimming pelagic forms which exhibit alternation of generations in their life-history, and
  in the sexual condition form colonies. The body is more or less fusiform, with the long axis
  antero-posterior, and the branchial and atrial apertures nearly terminal and opposite. The test is
  well developed but transparent. The musculature of the body-wall is in the form of a series of
  transversely-running bands which do not usually form complete independent rings as in the <span
  class="sc">Cyclomyaria</span>. These partially-encircling muscles in the Salpidae (see Fig. 61,
  <i>m.b</i>) are probably to be regarded as modified branchial and atrial sphincters which have
  spread over the intervening body. The branchial and peribranchial (cloacal) cavities form a
  continuous space in the interior of the body, opening externally at the ends by the branchial and
  atrial apertures, and traversed obliquely from the dorsal and anterior to the ventral and
  posterior end by a long narrow vascular ciliated band, which represents the dorsal lamina, the
  dorsal blood-sinus, and the neighbouring parts of the dorsal edge of the branchial sac of an
  ordinary Ascidian. The alimentary canal is placed ventrally. It may either be stretched out so as
  to extend for some distance anteriorly, or, as is more usual, be concentrated to form along with
  the testis a rounded opaque mass near the posterior end of the body, known as the visceral mass or
  "nucleus." The embryonic development is direct, no tailed larva being formed. The embryo is united
  to the parent for a time by a "placenta."</p>

  <p>This sub-order contains, in addition to its typical members, the <span
  class="sc">Salpidae</span>, another still somewhat problematical family the <span
  class="sc">Octacnemidae</span>, including a single very remarkable deep-water genus
  (<i>Octacnemus</i>), which in some respects does not conform with the characters given above, and
  exhibits a certain amount of affinity with the primitive fixed forms from which Salpidae have been
  derived.</p>

  <p><b>Occurrence and Reproduction.</b>&mdash;The family <span class="sc">Salpidae</span><a
  id="NtA_108" href="#Nt_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a> includes the single genus <i>Salpa</i>, Forsk&aring;l,
  which, however, may be divided into two well-marked groups of species&mdash;(1) those such as
  <i>S</i>. (<i>Cyclosalpa</i>) <i>pinnata</i>, in which the alimentary canal is stretched out
  ("ortho-enteric" condition) along the ventral surface of the body, and (2) those such as <i>S.
  runcinata-fusiformis</i>, in which the alimentary canal forms a compact globular mass (Fig. 61,
  <i>v</i>), the "nucleus" ("caryo-enteric" condition), near the posterior end of the body. About
  fifteen species altogether are known; they are all pelagic in habit, and are found in nearly all
  seas. Each species occurs in two forms (Fig. 61, A and B), the solitary asexual (<i>proles
  solitaria</i>), and the aggregated sexual (<i>proles gregaria</i>), which are in most species
  quite unlike one <span class="pagenum" id="page103"><span

  <p>The solitary form gives rise, by gemmation at the posterior end of the endostyle (Fig. 63), to
  a complex tubular stolon, containing processes from the more important organs of the parent-body,
  which give rise to an endodermal tube, two peribranchial tubes, a neural tube, two blood-sinuses
  and mesoblast cells, a genital cord, and over all the ectodermal covering (see Fig. 64). This
  stolon becomes segmented (Fig. 63) into a series of buds or young "chain" individuals, of which
  there may be several hundreds. As the stolon elongates (Fig. 61, B, <i>st&Prime;</i>), the buds
  <span class="pagenum" id="page104"><span class="smaller">{104}</span></span>undergo lateral
  shifting, and rotation round their longitudinal axis, so as to acquire the relations seen in the
  "chain," which then emerges from the tube in the test through which it has been growing, so as to
  project to the exterior near the atrial aperture. The buds at its free end which have now become
  far advanced in their development are set free in groups, which remain attached together by
  processes of the test, each enclosing a diverticulum from the body-wall (Fig. 62), so as to form
  "chains." Each member of the chain is a <i>Salpa</i> of the sexual or aggregated form, and when
  mature may&mdash;either still attached to its neighbours or separated from them&mdash;produce one
  or several embryos (Fig. 61, A, <i>emb</i>), which develop into the solitary form of <i>Salpa</i>.
  Thus the two forms, different in appearance and structure and different in mode of origin,
  alternate regularly in the life-history of <i>Salpa</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Structure.</b>&mdash;The more important points in the structure of a typical <i>Salpa</i>
  are shown in Fig. 65. The branchial and atrial apertures are at opposite ends of the body, and
  lead into large cavities, the branchial and peribranchial sac respectively, which are in free
  communication at the sides of the obliquely-running dorsal lamina or "gill" (<i>d.l</i>). The
  transparent test is usually thick, and varies from a gelatinous to a stiff cartilaginous
  condition; it adheres closely to the surface of the mantle (ectoderm and body-wall). The
  muscle-bands (from 4 to about 20&mdash;usually 8 or 10) of the mantle do not in most cases
  completely encircle the body. They are present dorsally (Fig. 65, <i>mus.bds</i>) and laterally,
  but the majority do not reach the ventral surface. In many cases neighbouring bands join in the
  median dorsal line (Fig. 61). The muscle fibres are striated, and have rows of large equidistant
  nuclei. The anterior end of the dorsal lamina is in some cases prolonged to form a prominent
  tentacular organ, the languet or dorsal tentacle, projecting into the branchial sac, while near
  this opens a ciliated funnel corresponding to the dorsal tubercle, but having no connexion in the
  adult with either ganglion or subneural gland. The conjoined ganglion and subneural gland, the
  dorsal lamina, the peripharyngeal bands and the endostyle are placed in the usual positions. Eyes
  in the form either of a continuous horse-shoe-shaped pigmented ridge on the dorsal surface of the
  ganglion immediately below the ectoderm, or of one larger median and several smaller lateral
  ocelli are found in the various species of <i>Salpa</i>. These eyes have in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page105"><span class="smaller">{105}</span></span>most cases a retina formed of elongated
  cells, and a pigment-layer placed upon the ganglion.</p>

  <p>The so-called otocysts of <i>Salpa</i> have been shown by Metcalf to be really glandular
  organs. They have been called lateral neural glands; they do not open at the dorsal tubercle, but
  separately into the pharynx. These lateral neural tubular glands have also been regarded as
  nephridia.</p>

  <p>The large spaces at the sides of the dorsal lamina (often called the gill or branchia of
  <i>Salpa</i>), by means of which the cavity of the branchial sac is placed in free communication
  with the peribranchial cavity, are to be regarded as gigantic gill-slits formed by the suppression
  of the lateral walls and small stigmata of the branchial sac. The alimentary canal at the
  posterior end of the "gill" consists of oesophagus, stomach, and intestine, with a pair of lateral
  gastric glands or caeca. These viscera along with the reproductive organs, when present, make up
  the "nucleus" (Fig. 66, <i>v</i>).</p>

  <p><b>Alternation of Generations.</b>&mdash;Fig. 66 represents an aggregated or sexual
  <i>Salpa</i>, which was once a member of a chain, since it shows a testis and a developing embryo.
  The ova (always few in number, usually only one) appear at a very early period in the developing
  chain <i>Salpa</i>, while it is still a part of the gemmiparous stolon in the body of the solitary
  <i>Salpa</i>. This gave rise to the view put forward first by Brooks that the ovary <span
  class="pagenum" id="page106"><span class="smaller">{106}</span></span>really belongs to the
  solitary stolon-bearing <i>Salpa</i>, which is therefore a female producing a series of males by
  asexual gemmation, and depositing in each of these an ovum, which will afterwards, when
  fertilised, develop in the body of the male into a solitary or female <i>Salpa</i>. This idea, if
  adopted, would profoundly modify our conception of <i>Salpa</i> as an example of a life-history
  showing alternation of generations, but it seems to me to give a distorted view of the sequence of
  events. The fact that the stolon while in the solitary <i>Salpa</i> contains, along with
  representatives of other important systems of the body, a row of germinal cells, does not
  constitute that solitary <i>Salpa</i> the parent of the ova which these germinal cells will
  afterwards become in the body of an independent bud. We must regard as the parent the body in
  which the ova become mature and fulfil their function. The sexual or chain <i>Salpa</i>, although
  really hermaphrodite in its life-history, is usually<a id="NtA_109"
  href="#Nt_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a> protogynous, <i>i.e.</i> the ova mature at an earlier period
  than the male organ or testis. This prevents self-fertilisation. The ovum is presumably fertilised
  by the spermatozoa of an older <i>Salpa</i> belonging to another chain, and the embryo is far
  advanced in its development before the testis is formed. The development takes place inside the
  body of the parent, and is "direct"&mdash;no tailed larval form being produced.</p>

  gives rise to a number of blastomeres, <span class="pagenum" id="page107"><span
  class="smaller">{107}</span></span>which are for a time masked by the phenomenal activity of
  certain cells of extraneous origin, the "kalymmocytes," derived from the follicular epithelium
  surrounding the ovum. These follicular kalymmocytes migrate into the ovum, surround groups of
  blastomeres, and arrange themselves so as to reproduce the essential structure of the future
  embryo for which they form what may be termed a scaffolding or temporary support. After a time the
  blastomeres become active, proliferate rapidly, and finally press upon and absorb the
  kalymmocytes, and so eventually take their proper place in building up the organs. Some observers
  regard the kalymmocytes as being passive and nutritive only in function.</p>

  <p>At an early period in the development a part of the surface of the embryo, on its ventral edge,
  becomes separated off, along with a part of the wall of the cavity ("oviduct"&mdash;a diverticulum
  from the atrium) in which it lies, to form the "placenta" (Fig. 67, <i>pl</i>) in which the
  embryonic and maternal blood-streams circulate in close proximity, and so allow of the conveyance
  of nutriment to the developing embryo by means of large migrating placental cells. At a somewhat
  later stage a number of cells placed at the posterior end of the body alongside the future nucleus
  become filled up with oil-globules to form a mass of nutrient material&mdash;the "elaeoblast"
  (Fig. 67, <i>ebl</i>)&mdash;which is used up later in the development. Many suggestions have been
  made as to the homology and meaning of the elaeoblast; but it may now be regarded as most probable
  that it is reserve food-material associated with the disappearing rudiment of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page108"><span class="smaller">{108}</span></span>tail found in the larval
  condition of most Ascidians. The development is direct; and it may be said, then, that this young
  asexual (solitary) <i>Salpa</i> differs from the corresponding form in the life-history of
  <i>Doliolum</i> (Fig. 60, A) in that its tail is no longer a locomotory organ, but is represented
  by a nutritive mass, the elaeoblast, while the body, in place of being free, is attached by its
  ventral surface to a special organ of nutrition&mdash;the "placenta"&mdash;in connexion with the
  blood-stream of the parent.</p>

  <p>This embryo sexually produced inside the body of an aggregated form becomes a solitary
  <i>Salpa</i> (such as Fig. 61, B), which differs in appearance, structure, and habits from its
  parent, and has no reproductive organs. After swimming for a time, however, it develops the
  ventral stolon on which buds form which are eventually sexual Salpae. These are set free from the
  solitary form in sets, still connected together, and they may swim about together for a time as a
  chain of aggregated Salpae before separating to become the adult sexual individuals (such as Fig.
  61, A).</p>

  <p><b>Classification.</b>&mdash;<i>Salpa</i> may be divided into the following subgenera:<a
  id="NtA_110" href="#Nt_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a>&mdash;<i>Cyclosalpa</i>, Blainville, in which the
  alimentary canal is ortho-enteric, and the "chain" consists of individuals united in a circle;
  <i>Iasis</i>, Savigny, with several embryos formed at a time; and <i>Pegea</i>, Sav.,
  <i>Thalia</i>, Blumenbach, and <i>Salpa</i>, Forsk&aring;l, all with one embryo only, and differing from
  one another in the condition of the "gill" and other details: all except <i>Cyclosalpa</i> have
  the alimentary canal caryo-enteric. <i>Cyclosalpa</i> has three species, the best known of which
  is <i>C. pinnata</i> of the Mediterranean, a form possessing light-producing organs like those of
  <i>Pyrosoma</i>, but placed along the sides of the body. <i>Salpa</i> has four or five species,
  one of which, <i>S. runcinata-fusiformis</i> (Fig. 61), has occasionally been found in British
  seas; <i>Thalia</i> includes the species <i>T. democratica-mucronata</i>, which has been sometimes
  obtained in swarms in the Hebridean seas, or cast ashore on our southern or western coasts;
  <i>Pegea</i> has the species <i>P. scutigera-confoederata</i>; and <i>Iasis</i> contains the
  remaining half-dozen species, the best known of which is <i>I. cordiformis-zonaria</i>, the only
  other Salpian which has been found in British seas.</p>

  <p>The family <span class="sc">Octacnemidae</span> includes the single remarkable genus
  <i>Octacnemus</i>, now known in a solitary and an aggregated form. It was found during the
  "Challenger" expedition, and was first described by Moseley. It is apparently a deep-sea
  representative of the pelagic Salpidae, and may possibly be fixed at the bottom. The body in the
  solitary form is somewhat discoid, with its margin prolonged to form eight tapering processes, on
  to which the muscle-bands of the mantle are continued. The alimentary canal forms a compact
  nucleus, which is attached to an apparently imperforate membrane which stretches across the body,
  separating the branchial from the atrial cavities. The endostyle is very short, and the dorsal
  lamina is also much reduced. The reproduction and life-history are entirely unknown. The
  aggregated form consists of a small number of individuals united by a slender cord composed of
  test, body-wall, and endodermal tissue. <i>Octacnemus</i> has been found<a id="NtA_111"
  href="#Nt_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> in the South Pacific from depths of 1070 and 2160 fathoms, and
  off the Patagonian coast from 1050 fathoms. Two species have been described: <i>O. bythius</i>,
  Moseley, and <i>O. patagoniensis</i>, Metcalf. Metcalf, who has recently investigated the
  aggregated form (<i>O. patagoniensis</i>), considers that the genus is more nearly related to the
  Clavelinidae than to the Salpidae. Possibly its position might be best <span class="pagenum"

  <p class="ac"><b>General Conclusions.</b></p>

  <p>The following diagram is a graphic representation of the genetic affinities, or what is now
  generally supposed to have been the probable course of phylogeny of the Tunicata. It will be
  noticed that it shows (1) the Proto-Tunicates arising from Proto-Chordata, not far from the
  ancestors of Amphioxus (see also, this vol. <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page112">112</a></span>); (2) that the Larvacea are regarded as the most primitive section
  of the group; (3) that the Thaliacea (Doliolidae and Salpidae) are supposed to be derived not
  directly from primitive pelagic forms, but through the early fixed Ascidians, not far from (4) the
  ancestral compound Ascidians, which gave rise to the Pyrosomatidae; (5) that the Ascidiidae and
  other higher Simple Ascidians are derived, like the Compound Ascidians, from ancestral
  Clavelinidae; and (6), that the Ascidiae Compositae are polyphyletic, the Holosomata (Botryllidae
  and Polystyelidae) being derived from ancestral Simple Ascidians independently of the Merosomatous
  families.</p>

  <p>The Tunicata are remarkable for the variety in appearance, structure, and life-history which
  they present. No group illustrates in a more instructive manner so large a number of important
  biological principles and phenomena. They show solitary and colonial forms, fixed and free,
  pelagic and abyssal. The development is in some cases larval and with metamorphosis, in others
  abbreviated and direct. Persistent traces of ancestral characters are seen in the embryonic and
  larval stages, while the adults present the most varied secondary adaptations to littoral, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page111"><span class="smaller">{111}</span></span>pelagic, and deep-sea,
  free-swimming and sessile modes of existence. In the details of their classification they
  demonstrate both stable and variable species, monophyletic and polyphyletic groups. They exhibit
  the phenomena of gemmation and of embryonic fission, of polymorphism, hibernation, alternation of
  generations, and change of function. They have long been known as a stock example of degeneration;
  but in fact they lend themselves admirably to the exposition of more than one "Chapter of
  Darwinism."</p>

  CHARACTERS&mdash;ANATOMY OF AMPHIOXUS&mdash;EMBRYOLOGY AND LIFE-HISTORY&mdash;CLASSIFICATION  OF
  CEPHALOCHORDATA&mdash;SPECIES AND DISTRIBUTION</span></p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Cephalochordata</span> comprise only a small group of little fish-like
  forms, the Lancelets, usually known as "Amphioxus," and referable to about a dozen species
  arranged in several closely allied genera under the single family Branchiostomatidae. The best
  known form is <i>Branchiostoma lanceolatum</i> (Pallas), the common Amphioxus or Lancelet, which
  has been found in British seas, and even as far north as the coast of Norway, but is much more
  common in warmer waters, such as the Mediterranean, and is also found in the Indian Ocean. It is
  abundant in the Bay of Naples, and lives and breeds in great numbers in a salt lagoon, the
  "Pantano," near Messina, and from these localities most of the specimens have been obtained for
  the numerous recent researches upon its structure and development.</p>

  <p>Amphioxus was first discovered and described (1778) by Pallas, who regarded it as a Mollusc,
  and named it <i>Limax lanceolatus</i>. It was first correctly diagnosed as a low Vertebrate, and
  named <i>Branchiostoma</i>, by Costa, in 1834. The term <i>Amphioxus</i>, under which it has
  become so well known, was applied to it a couple of years later by Yarrell.</p>

  <p>The anatomy was for the first time fully investigated by Johannes M&uuml;ller in 1841, and this
  important memoir has been supplemented in regard to special systems and histological details by
  numerous papers by many leading zoologists, such as those by Huxley in 1874, Langerhans in 1876,
  Lankester in <span class="pagenum" id="page113"><span class="smaller">{113}</span></span>1875 and
  in 1889, Retzius in 1890, and Boveri and Hatschek, both in 1892. Important papers on special
  points have also been written by Rolph, Rohde, Benham, Andrews, Goodrich, and others. The
  development was first elucidated by Kowalevsky in 1867, at about the same time when he studied the
  development of the Ascidians, and later again in 1877. Further papers on the development and
  metamorphosis we owe to Hatschek in 1881, Lankester and Willey in 1890 and 1891, Wilson in 1893,
  and quite recently to MacBride. Dr. Willey's book, <i>Amphioxus and the Ancestry of the
  Vertebrata</i> (1894), contains a summary of investigations on structure and development, an
  interesting discussion of the relations of Amphioxus to the other Chordata, and a full
  bibliography.</p>

  <p>In addition to such original researches, Amphioxus is studied in more or less detail every year
  by countless senior and junior students in zoological laboratories and marine stations throughout
  the civilised world. The value of this primitive form as an object of biological education depends
  upon the fact that it shows the essential Vertebrate characters, and their mode of formation, in a
  very simple and instructive condition. Although no doubt somewhat modified, and possibly
  degenerate in some details of structure, in its general morphology it presents us with a
  persistent type probably not far removed from the ancestral line of early Chordata. There are no
  sufficient grounds for the view that Amphioxus is a very degenerate representative of fish-like
  Vertebrata.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>General Characters.</b>&mdash;The Cephalochordata (or Acrania, in
  contradistinction to the Craniata or Vertebrata) are marine, non-colonial Chordata, in which the
  notochord extends the entire length of the body, running forward into the snout beyond the nervous
  system. There is no skull, and the notochord is not surrounded by any vertebral column. There are
  no limbs nor paired fins. There is no exoskeleton, and the ectoderm is a single layer of
  non-ciliated columnar cells. The mouth is ventral and anterior, the anus is ventral, posterior,
  and asymmetrically placed on the left side. The pharynx is a large branchial sac, having its sides
  perforated by many gill-slits, and is surrounded by an ectodermal enclosure, the atrium, which
  opens to the exterior by a median ventral atriopore. The stomach gives off a simple saccular
  pouch, the liver, which has <span class="pagenum" id="page114"><span
  class="smaller">{114}</span></span>connected with it a simple hepatic portal blood system. There
  is a respiratory circulation, the contractile ventral vessel which represents the heart sending
  the colourless blood forward to the respiratory pharynx to be purified. The body-wall is segmented
  into over fifty myotomes. There are numerous separate nephridia which develop from the mesoderm
  and open into the atrium. The brain remains undeveloped, being scarcely distinct from the spinal
  cord. There are two pairs of cerebral nerves, and many spinal, in which the dorsal and ventral
  roots or nerves do not unite. The sense-organs are simple; there are no paired eyes and no
  auditory organs. The sexes are separate; the gonads are metamerically arranged on the body-wall,
  and have no ducts: they burst into the atrium. In the development the segmentation is complete, a
  gastrula is formed by invagination, the nervous system is formed from the dorsal epiblast, the
  notochord from the hypoblast, and the mesoderm arises from metameric coelomic pouches. The
  body-cavity is an enterocoele. The gill-slits are at first perforations of the body-wall opening
  from the pharynx to the exterior, which later become enclosed by the development of the
  atrium.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Anatomy.</span></p>

  <p><b>External Characters.</b>&mdash;Amphioxus<a id="NtA_112" href="#Nt_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a>
  is about 1&frac12; to 2&frac12; inches in length, slender, somewhat translucent, and pointed at both ends (Fig.
  69). It lives in shallow water and burrows in the sand, head first, with great rapidity. It
  frequently remains with the anterior end protruding from the sand. When on the surface it lies on
  one side. It is said to swim freely at night. The head end is rather the thicker, and the anterior
  two-thirds of the ventral surface are flattened (Fig. 70, A), and may be slightly ridged
  longitudinally. The lateral edges of this flat area project as metapleural folds (Fig. 70,
  <i>mt.pl</i>), which begin anteriorly at the edges of the external mouth, and die away in the
  middle line posteriorly behind a median opening, the atriopore (Fig. 70, <i>atrp</i>). From this
  point a ventral median fin (<i>vent.f</i>) extends backwards around the pointed posterior end
  <span class="pagenum" id="page115"><span class="smaller">{115}</span></span>(caudal fin,
  <i>cd.f</i>), and then forwards along the upper surface (dorsal fin, <i>dors.f</i>) to the
  anterior end of the body. These fins thus constitute a continuous median fold around a great part
  of the animal (Fig. 70, B, and Fig. 71).</p>

  <p>The true mouth is a small pore at the bottom of a large vestibule (the stomodaeum), placed at
  the anterior end of the ventral surface (Figs. 70 and 71), and formed by the "oral hood," which
  may be a prolongation forwards of the atrial or metapleural folds at each side. The edges of the
  oral hood bear 12 to 20 pairs of cirri (Fig. 70, <i>cir</i>) or ciliated tentacles (strengthened
  by skeletal rods), which form a sensory fringe around the opening. The anus (Figs. 70 and 71,
  <i>an</i>), is asymmetrical, being <span class="pagenum" id="page117"><span
  class="smaller">{117}</span></span>placed on the left side of the ventral fin, some distance
  behind the atriopore, and not far from the posterior end of the body. The short region behind the
  anus and surrounded by the caudal fin may properly be called "tail." The current of water for
  respiratory and nutritive purposes, and which may carry the ova and spermatozoa to the exterior,
  usually passes in at the mouth and out at the atriopore, as in the Tunicata. On occasions,
  however, it is said to be reversed.</p>

  <p><b>General Structure.</b>&mdash;The general plan of organisation of the body (see Fig. 71) is
  that a longitudinal skeletal axis, the notochord (<i>nch</i>), separates a dorsal nervous system
  (<i>sp.cd</i>) from a ventral reduced coelom (<i>coel</i>), in which lie the alimentary canal
  (<i>int</i>), the gonads (<i>gon</i>), and other organs. Thus a transverse section of the body
  (see Fig. 72) shows the typical Chordate arrangement of parts, and is comparable with a transverse
  section of a tadpole, a young fish, or a larval Ascidian. A peribranchial (<i>atr</i>) or atrial
  cavity (which is morphologically a part of the external world shut in) lies external to the coelom
  and body-wall around the pharynx and the greater part of the alimentary canal, and opens to the
  exterior by the atriopore. As in the Tunicata, the perforations (gill-slits) in the wall of the
  pharynx (<i>br.cl</i>) open into the atrial cavity and so indirectly to the exterior.</p>

  <p><b>Musculature.</b>&mdash;The thick body-wall is largely formed by muscular tissue
  metamerically segmented into about 60 myotomes (Fig. 71, <i>myom</i>). These muscle-masses, which
  (as is usual in Vertebrata) are thickest dorsally at the sides of the notochord and spinal chord
  (Fig. 72, <i>m</i>), are so arranged as to present the appearance in a lateral view of the body of
  a series of shallow cones (&lt;&lt;) fitting into one another and with their apices directed
  forwards. The muscle fibres are striated, and run longitudinally along the body from the anterior
  to the posterior edge of each myotome, so as to be attached at their ends to the two septa of
  connective tissue which form the boundaries of the myotomes. These septa, the myocommas, are
  conspicuous features in the external appearance of the body (Fig. 70, B). They are not arranged so
  as to be opposite one another on the two sides, but the myotomes on the right and left sides
  alternate, as can be seen in a transverse section (Fig. 74, A, <span class="wnw">p. <a

  <p>It is by means of these lateral muscle-bundles that the rapid vibration or alternate bending of
  the body from side to side in swimming or burrowing can be performed. There are usually, on each
  side, 35 myotomes in front of the atriopore, 14 between the atriopore and the anus, and 11
  postanal, making 60 in all: some species have only about 50 myotomes, and some as many as 85. (See

  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page137">137</a></span>, where a list of the species with the number of
  myotomes in each is given.)</p>

  <p>There are also transverse muscles (Fig. 72, <i>mt</i>) extending across the ventral surface in
  the region of the body enclosed by the metapleural folds, and serving to compress the atrial
  cavity, and so aid in the expulsion of its contents.</p>

  <p>Outside the muscular layer of the body-wall the thin integument is formed of a dermal layer of
  soft connective tissue, covered by the epidermis, a single layer of columnar cells, many of which,
  especially on the oral cirri, have sensory bristles.</p>

  <p><b>Skeleton.</b>&mdash;The endoskeleton consists of the notochord and some tracts of modified
  connective tissue which support various parts of the body.</p>

  <p>The notochord of this animal is noteworthy amongst Chordata for extending practically the
  entire length of the body, including the head, from snout to tip of tail (Fig. 71). It lies in the
  median plane, but nearer the dorsal than the ventral surface (Fig. 72), and has the myotomes at
  its sides, the nervous system above and the alimentary canal below. It is elliptical in section,
  and tapers to the two ends. The nuclei of the original notochordal cells are displaced to the
  dorsal and ventral edges, and the greater parts of the cells, in the adult, are occupied by large
  vacuoles filled with a fluid secretion, so as to form by their distended condition a stiff elastic
  structure. This state of the cells, and the appearance it gives rise to (Fig. 73), seen best in
  young specimens, is very characteristic of notochordal tissue. Around the notochord lies a sheath
  of connective tissue which is continuous with the similar sheath around the nervous system and
  with the septa between the myotomes.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In addition to these skeletal layers of connective tissue there is a cartilage-like tract in
  the oral hood. This is jointed, or made up of separate rod-like pieces, one at the base of each
  cirrus, into which it sends a prolongation (Fig. 71, <i>sk</i>). The dorsal and ventral fins are
  supported by single and double rows <span class="pagenum" id="page120"><span
  class="smaller">{120}</span></span>respectively of what have been called "fin-rays." They are
  short rods of gelatinous connective tissue, each enclosed in a lymph space. Finally, the bars
  constituting the walls of the pharynx between the gill-slits contain slender skeletal rods which
  run obliquely dorso-ventrally, and are of a stiff, gelatinous nature (see Fig. 75, <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page122">122</a></span>). This skeletal connective tissue consists in all
  cases of a fibrous deposit or matrix produced by the layer of epithelium (ectodermal, endodermal,
  or mesodermal) which adjoins the tissue.</p>

  <p><b>Alimentary Canal.</b>&mdash;This has, as its most noteworthy feature, the Chordate
  characteristic that the pharynx gives rise to the respiratory organ (see Figs. 71 and 74, A); and
  in size and prominence, both in side view and in sections, the modified pharynx of Amphioxus is
  fairly comparable with the branchial sac (pharynx) of many Tunicata (see Fig. 23, <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page51">51</a></span>), and might be called by the same name.</p>

  <p>The small primitive mouth, at the bottom of the cavity bounded by the oral hood (stomodaeum),
  has a membranous border, the velum (Fig. 71, <i>vl</i>), the edges of which are prolonged into a
  circle of 10 or 12 (up to 16 in some species) simple oral tentacles turned inwards towards the
  pharynx (compare tentacles of Ascidians, p. 45).</p>

  <p>The pharynx, by far the largest part of the alimentary canal, and extending nearly half-way
  along the body, is more important as a respiratory than as a nutritive organ. Its walls over
  nearly the whole extent are perforated by a large, and indefinite, number (100 or more on each
  side) of gill-slits which run on the whole dorso-ventrally, but in the contracted condition seen
  in preserved specimens have their lower ends directed obliquely backwards, so that a vertical
  transverse section may cut through a number of such slits and the intervening branchial bars (Fig.
  74, A, <i>kb</i>). These bars, and therefore the slits between them, are of two orders, primary
  and secondary, the latter being developed later in larval life as downgrowths or "tongue-bars,"
  one from the top of each primary gill-slit, so as to divide it into two secondaries. The primary
  and the secondary (or tongue-) bars can be distinguished from one another by their structure in
  the adult animal (Fig. 75, A and B).</p>

  <p>It must be remembered that these branchial bars, or septa between the gill-slits, are not
  merely portions of the wall of the pharynx, but are in a sense portions of the body-wall as well,
  and correspond in nature, though not in number, to the visceral arches in a Vertebrate lying
  between the visceral clefts which open on the exterior. In the adult Amphioxus the clefts in the
  wall of the pharynx do not open directly to the exterior, but into the peribranchial cavity or
  atrium, which, however, is only formed at a late larval period as an invagination or enclosure of
  ectoderm. Previous to that the first formed gill-slits opened to the exterior in Amphioxus (see
  larva, Fig. 86, <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page134">134</a></span>), just as they do in a fish
  or a young tadpole. The atrial cavity is therefore, from its origin, lined by ectoderm, and the
  outer surface of a branchial bar is virtually a part of the outer surface of the body. It is only
  natural then to find that each bar contains a small section of the coelom in its interior,
  communicating dorsally and ventrally with other parts of that cavity (see Figs. 75 and 76). There
  are also blood-vessels which run in the branchial bars and their junctions. The greater part of
  the epithelium covering a branchial bar is pharyngeal epithelium or endoderm <span class="pagenum"
  id="page122"><span class="smaller">{122}</span></span>(Fig. 75, <i>br.ep</i>), but the external,
  wider, non-ciliated cells (Fig. 75, <i>at.ep</i>) are ectodermal cells lining the atrium. The
  gelatinous skeletal rods in the primary bars are forked ventrally, while those in the secondary
  bars are simple; and there are other points of detail in which the two kinds of bar differ. These
  bars are obviously more numerous in the adult than the myotomes, but in the young larva the first
  formed gill-clefts are metamerically arranged, and then later they increase greatly in number. It
  is the cilia covering the pharyngeal epithelium on the branchial bars, possibly aided by the
  ciliated tracts of the oral hood, which cause the current of water already alluded to.</p>

  <p>Transverse branchial junctions (synapticula) run across the branchial bars, connecting them at
  frequent intervals, and these transverse connexions, like the branchial bars, are supported by
  skeletal rods. Along the ventral median line of the pharynx runs a groove, the endostyle or
  hypopharyngeal groove, comparable with the similar structure in the branchial sac of Tunicata.
  This longitudinal groove (Fig. 76, <i>gl</i>) is lined by ciliated epithelium containing four
  tracts of gland cells (compare endostyle in Ascidians, Fig. 20, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page46">46</a></span>). There is reason to believe that this organ is the homologue of the
  thyroid gland of Vertebrata. As in the case of Tunicata the endostyle secretes mucus, which is
  carried forwards by the cilia to constitute a train with entangled food particles which pass back
  dorsally to the stomach. At the anterior end the ciliated lips of the endostyle diverge to <span
  class="pagenum" id="page123"><span class="smaller">{123}</span></span>the right and left to
  encircle the front of the pharynx as the peripharyngeal bands. These unite again dorsally to form
  the epipharyngeal (or hyperpharyngeal) groove which leads backwards, corresponding to the
  hypopharyngeal groove below (see Fig. 74, A), till the posterior end of the pharynx is
  reached.</p>

  <p>The remainder of the simple alimentary canal is straight, and is scarcely differentiated into
  regions. A slight narrowing of the tube behind the pharynx has been called the oesophagus, and a
  slight enlargement which follows, the stomach. From this point the intestine tapers backwards to
  the anus (Fig. 71, <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page116">116</a></span>). The ventral edge of
  the stomach gives off a blind pouch, the hepatic caecum or saccular liver, which runs forwards on
  the right-hand side of the pharynx (Fig. 74, A, <i>l</i>). This is a digestive gland, is lined
  with glandular epithelium, and apparently corresponds with the liver of Vertebrata. There are no
  other digestive glands in connexion with the alimentary canal of Amphioxus.</p>

  <p><b>Coelom.</b>&mdash;In the young larva there are at first (as in Balanoglossus) five coelomic
  spaces, a median anterior "head-cavity," a pair of antero-lateral "collar-cavities," and a pair of
  more posterior long lateral grooves from which arise, in the later larva, the segmented myotomes
  and ventrally a large coelomic space surrounding the alimentary canal and separating it from the
  body-wall. In the adult animal, however, the coelom has been so much displaced by the formation of
  the spacious atrium that in front of the atriopore it can only be recognised as a series of canals
  and crevices. The relations of coelom to atrium in the region of the intestine are <span
  class="pagenum" id="page124"><span class="smaller">{124}</span></span>seen in Fig. 74, B, and in
  the region of the pharynx in Fig. 74, A. Fig. 72 shows the distribution of the spaces more in
  detail (see also Fig. 71). Beginning anteriorly, along the dorsal surface of the pharynx and
  beneath the notochord run a pair of dorsal coelomic canals, one at each side of the epipharyngeal
  groove; these give off ventral diverticula which pass down the primary branchial bars of the
  pharyngeal wall and unite ventrally in a median tube, the endostylar coelom (see Fig. 72,
  <i>ec</i>). At the posterior end of the pharynx these dorsal and ventral canals unite in a narrow
  coelomic space encircling the stomach, inside the wall of the atrium, and sending an extension
  forwards around the liver (Fig. 74, A, <i>l</i>). In the region of the intestine, behind the
  atriopore, the coelom is allowed to expand to its primitive condition on the left-hand side (Fig.
  74, B), but is still reduced on the right side, where there is a prolongation of the atrial cavity
  reaching nearly to the anus. All these coelomic spaces are lined by a coelomic epithelium.</p>

  <p>The <b>Blood System</b> of Amphioxus, although as simple as that of a Chaetopod worm, is
  undoubtedly laid down on the Vertebrate plan&mdash;even though there is no distinct heart and the
  vessels are few and of simple structure. Capillary networks are formed in some places, but the
  colourless blood also extends into many lacunae or lymph spaces, such as those around the fin-rays
  and in the metapleura. As in a typical lower Vertebrate, there is a contractile ventral vessel
  (the ventral or branchial aorta, Fig. 77, <i>v.ao</i>) running forwards under the alimentary canal
  to the pharynx, and giving off on each side afferent branchial vessels, which pass up the primary
  branchial bars and give off branches joining the vessels in the secondary bars. These latter do
  not communicate directly with the ventral aorta, but the vessels in all the branchial bars open
  dorsally by efferent branchial vessels into the paired dorsal aortae (Fig. 77, <i>d.ao</i>), which
  run backwards along the top of the pharynx, one at each side of the epipharyngeal groove. In the
  vessels of the branchial bars and their connectives the blood is aerated by the current of water
  passing through the gill-slits, and so reaches the dorsal aortae in a purified condition. The
  right-hand dorsal aorta is continued forward further into the snout than its fellow of the other
  side, and is dilated at its extremity (Fig. 77). At the posterior end of the pharynx the paired
  dorsal aortae unite to form the median dorsal aorta <span class="pagenum" id="page125"><span
  class="smaller">{125}</span></span>which runs backwards, lying between notochord and alimentary
  canal. This vessel gives off branches to the wall of the intestine, and these break up into
  capillary networks (Fig. 77, <i>cp</i>), from which the blood is collected by the median
  sub-intestinal vein. This then flows forwards to pass by the hepatic portal vein to the ventral
  edge of the saccular liver, in the wall of which it is distributed in a capillary network. The
  blood is collected on the dorsal edge of the liver by the hepatic vein, which runs posteriorly and
  then turns downwards and forwards to become continuous with the posterior end of the ventral aorta
  or "heart."</p>

  <p>It is clear that this course of the circulation agrees with that of a typical lower Vertebrate
  in all essential points:&mdash;(1) in having the main artery a dorsal aorta in which the blood
  flows backwards; (2) in having a ventral vessel representing the heart, and sending impure blood
  forwards to the respiratory region of the alimentary canal to be aerated; and (3) in having a
  hepatic portal system consisting of the capillaries of the liver, through which the blood from the
  intestinal wall has to pass before reaching the ventral vessel (heart).</p>

  <p><b>Renal Excretory</b> functions have been attributed to various organs in Amphioxus, and it is
  quite possible that, in addition to the true nephridia which are now known, other tracts of tissue
  in the body may be able to eliminate nitrogenous waste matters. Such are certain clumps of
  columnar epithelial cells on the floor of the atrium, and the single pair of large brown
  atrio-coelomic funnels lying on the dorsal edge of the posterior end of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page126"><span class="smaller">{126}</span></span>pharynx (Fig. 71, <i>br.f</i>). There are,
  however, a large number (about 100 pairs) of minute nephridia, discovered (1890) by Weiss and by
  Boveri independently, lying at the sides of the dorsal coelomic canals above the pharynx, which
  must be regarded as the chief functional renal organs. These are bent tubules, partly glandular
  and partly ciliated, each giving off several caecal knobs (at first supposed to be open
  nephrostomes, one shown at each end of the tubule and three along its upper surface in Fig. 78),
  which project into the coelom, and opening by one nephridiopore (on the lower surface, and
  opposite a tongue bar of the pharynx) into the atrial cavity. The knobs, or closed nephrostomes,
  are surrounded by peculiar, slender, club-shaped tubular and flagellated cells&mdash;which
  Goodrich<a id="NtA_113" href="#Nt_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> has shown to correspond to the

  <p>The <b>Central Nervous System</b> is dorsal and tubular as in Vertebrates, and lies in a
  connective-tissue sheath immediately above the notochord (Figs. 71, etc., and 80, A). Posteriorly
  it tapers to a fine point a little in front of the end of the notochord, but anteriorly it ends
  abruptly some distance behind the anterior extremity of the notochord. The central canal is
  connected with the dorsal surface by a median longitudinal cleft (Fig. 80, C), and at the anterior
  end it dilates to form the cerebral vesicle (<i>c.v</i>) with which two simple sense-organs, an
  eye-spot (<i>e</i>) and an olfactory pit (<i>olf</i>), are connected. A patch of ciliated
  epithelium in the floor of the vesicle has been described as an "infundibular-organ." There is
  also a surface dilatation of the dorsal cleft behind the cerebral vesicle (<i>dil</i>). The
  nervous system as far back as this point may be regarded as the brain, though scarcely
  distinguishable externally (Figs. 71 and 80, A) from the spinal chord behind. From this "brain"
  arise two pairs of "cranial" nerves, the first (I.) from the anterior end, and the second (II.)
  from the dorsal surface of the cerebral vesicle; both are in front of the first myotomes of the
  body, and supply the pre-oral snout with nerves.</p>

  <p>The spinal cord gives off a large number of spinal nerves segmentally arranged, but, like the
  myotomes, not opposite and symmetrical on the two sides, but placed alternately (Fig. 81).
  Moreover, the spinal nerves arise on each side at two levels, there being a more dorsal series
  each arising by a single root and <span class="pagenum" id="page128"><span
  class="smaller">{128}</span></span>supplying the integument as well as the transverse muscles, so
  as to be sensory as well as motor, and a ventral series arising each by a number of roots (Fig.
  81) and wholly motor in function, as they supply only the myotomes. These two series may be
  compared to the dorsal and ventral roots which in the Vertebrata join to form a mixed spinal
  nerve.</p>

  <p>In addition to ordinary small nerve cells the central nervous system contains certain large
  nerve cells with very long processes, the "giant fibres," which extend through the greater part of
  the length of the spinal cord. No trace of a sympathetic nervous system has been found.</p>

  <p>The <b>Sense-Organs</b> connected with the nervous system are few and simple. There are sensory
  cells in the ectoderm, on the margin of the velum, on the velar tentacles, and especially in
  clumps on papillae of the cirri around the mouth, which are probably tactile. In the roof of the
  oral hood there is a sensory structure, the "groove of Hatschek," which is supposed to be an organ
  of taste. The olfactory pit alluded to above opens externally on the left-hand side of the snout.
  It is ciliated internally and leads to the so-called olfactory lobe, an <span class="pagenum"
  id="page129"><span class="smaller">{129}</span></span>antero-dorsal hollow outgrowth from the
  brain. In the young animal the olfactory pit opens by the neuropore into the central canal (Fig.
  80, A), but that passage is closed in the adult. Possibly the olfactory pit is homologous with the
  hypophysis or pituitary body of Vertebrates, the homologue of which in Tunicata has a ciliated
  funnel. Finally, the median cerebral eye (Figs. 80 and 81) is a mere pigment spot in the anterior
  wall of the cerebral vesicle, and a series of somewhat similar pigment spots occurs along the
  floor of the central canal in the spinal cord.<a id="NtA_114" href="#Nt_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a>
  There is no known auditory organ. On the under surface of the oral hood patches of ciliated
  epithelium drawn out into rounded lobes were called by Johannes M&uuml;ller the "R&auml;der-organ." This is
  probably of use in drawing water inwards to the pharynx, but it may also be a sense-organ.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The <b>Gonads</b> are segmentally arranged along the sides of the body, projecting
  into the atrial cavity at the sides of the pharynx and intestine. In some species the gonads are
  paired, but in others belonging to the genus <i>Asymmetron</i> (p. 137) only a single series, that
  of the right side, is present. In the common Amphioxus (<i>Branchiostoma lanceolatum</i>) there
  are about 26 pairs (Fig. 70, B), lying in somites 25 to 51; and ovaries and testes are found in
  separate individuals in all other respects. Each gonad is surrounded by a layer of coelomic
  epithelium. The gonad must therefore be regarded as having grown down from a myotome of the
  body-wall into a coelomic pouch, carrying before it the coelomic and then the atrial epithelium
  (Figs. 72, and 74, A, <i>g</i>). Eventually the gonads, when ripe, burst through the layers of
  epithelium, and the ova and sperms are shed into the atrium and escape to the exterior by the
  atriopore, or it may be in some cases by the mouth.</p>

      <b>A</b> represents the eight-celled stage; <b>B</b>, the sixteen-celled; <b>D</b>, vertical
      section of <b>C</b>; <b>F</b>, vertical section of the blastosphere or blastula stage
      (<b>E</b>). (From Korschelt and Heider, after Hatschek.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The egg is small (0.105 mm. in diameter when shed) and contains very little food-yolk.
  Segmentation is complete (Fig. 82, A), is nearly regular, and results in the formation of a hollow
  blastosphere (Fig. 82, E, F), the wall of which is one cell thick. The lower cells (Fig. 82, B, C,
  D) are slightly larger than the upper. Invagination of the lower cells then takes place (Fig. 83,
  A), resulting in the suppression of the blastocoele or segmentation cavity and the formation of an
  archenteron, at first shallow and opening widely to the exterior (Fig. 83, B), and then deeper and
  with the opening narrowed to a small posterior blastopore (Fig. 83, C). This "gastrula" stage
  differs from the blastosphere in having a mouth or blastopore, and in being two cell-layers
  thick&mdash;epiblast (ectoderm) on the outside and hypoblast (endoderm) within. It soon shows the
  future aspects of the body by its <span class="pagenum" id="page131"><span
  class="smaller">{131}</span></span>elongation and shape (Fig. 83, C), as the dorsal surface
  becomes flat and the ventral convex, while the blastopore is at the posterior end of the dorsal
  surface. The blastopore soon closes, and the mouth and anus are formed independently later.</p>

      after Hatschek.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The epiblast cells become ciliated all over the surface, so that the embryo rotates within the
  thin covering which still surrounds it. And now all the chief systems of the body begin to be
  marked out. The tubular nervous system develops from a depression of the epiblast (the medullary
  plate) in the middle line of the flattened dorsal surface (Fig. 84, A, <i>mp</i>). The edges of
  the depressed area grow inwards and unite over the deeper layer of epiblast, which becomes the
  wall of the neural canal or embryonic nervous system (Fig. 84, D, <i>n</i>); and further back
  these edges of the medullary plate join one another behind the blastopore, so that the latter
  comes to open into the floor of the neural canal, thus forming the neurenteric canal (Fig. 85, A,
  <i>cn</i>). Anteriorly the neural canal (<i>n</i>) opens to the exterior for some time by the
  neuropore.</p>

  <p>The hypoblastic walls of the archenteron give off a long median dorsal groove which becomes the
  notochord (Fig. 84, C and D, <i>ch</i>); and also an anterior pouch and certain lateral pairs
  <span class="pagenum" id="page132"><span class="smaller">{132}</span></span>of diverticula which
  are the enterocoeles or coelomic pouches, and give rise to the mesoblastic somites (Fig. 84, B and
  C, <i>mk</i>). The notochord (Fig. 84, D, <i>ch</i>) is at first a longitudinal cellular ridge,
  which becomes segmented off from the hypoblast as a rod lying below the neural canal. It is seen
  in various stages of development in Figs. 84 and 86, leading to the vacuolated condition of the
  adult.</p>

  <p>The mouth now appears, and soon grows to a large opening on the left side of the now pointed

  <p>The walls of the coelomic pouches, which have been extending both dorsally and ventrally (Fig.
  84, D), become the <span class="pagenum" id="page135"><span
  class="smaller">{135}</span></span>mesoderm, the outer the somatic and the inner the splanchnic
  layer; and the ventral parts of their cavities unite to form the coelom. The cells of the dorsal
  parts become muscle fibres, and constitute the myotomes internally and the connective tissue of
  the skin externally.</p>

  <p>The larva (Fig. 87) is now long and narrow with many segments, pointed ends, and a caudal fin.
  The gill-slits all appear first in the mid-ventral line and then shift over to the right side
  (Fig. 87, 1-4): they are metamerically arranged. After fourteen have been so formed a series of
  eight appear dorsally to those on the right side, and then the first set, originally ventral, move
  over to the left side, and by the suppression of some they become equal in number and segmentally
  arranged on the two sides of the body. This is perhaps the stage at which Amphioxus shows the
  nearest approach to the typical embryo of a higher Vertebrate. The gill-slits are here seven to
  nine on each side, and the Vertebrate embryo has usually five to seven on each side. These first
  gill-slits in Amphioxus are later subdivided by the downgrowth of the tongue-bar from the dorsal
  edge.</p>

  <p>The atrium is an ingrowth of the external space between the two ventral metapleural or atrial
  folds (Figs. 88 and 89), paired lateral ridges of the body-wall, and so is lined by ectoderm. This
  ingrowth is shut off from the exterior by the <span class="pagenum" id="page136"><span
  class="smaller">{136}</span></span>growth towards each other of sub-atrial ridges on the inner
  sides of the metapleural folds (see Fig. 89, A, <i>sl</i>), and then becomes greatly enlarged by
  the increased relative growth of the ventro-lateral part of the body-wall (Fig. 89, B, C). The
  posterior opening between the metapleural folds remains as the atriopore (Fig. 88, C, <i>ap</i>);
  while the anterior end (Fig. 88) also remains open for some time, but eventually closes. As the
  metapleural folds lie outside the gill-slits (Fig. 88, A) when these folds close in (B and C), it
  comes about that the gill-slits which formerly opened freely to the exterior now open into the
  cavity of the atrium (compare Figs. 87 and 88).</p>

  <p>The mouth now becomes median and ventral, and is reduced in size, the oral hood (stomodaeum) is
  formed in front of it, the gill-slits become more numerous and vertically elongated, the endostyle
  forms along the floor of the pharynx, and the gonads grow as paired pouches from the body-wall.

  months after the fertilisation of the egg.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="smaller">THE SYSTEMATIC POSITION AND
  CLASSIFICATION OF FISHES</span></p>

  <p>In the first chapter of this volume it was pointed out that the Craniata, of which the Fishes
  form a subordinate group, is the last of the four principal divisions into which the Chordata are
  divided. The animals included in the first three, viz. the Hemichordata, the Urochordata, and the
  Cephalochordata, have already been dealt with in the earlier chapters, and it now remains for us
  briefly to consider the diagnostic characters of the Craniata, and then, more in detail, the
  organisation of the Fishes.</p>

  <p>The Craniata, often termed Vertebrata, form one of the best defined and most easily
  recognisable divisions of the animal kingdom. As the name implies, they are distinguished from the
  more primitive Chordata by the formation of a definite "head," as the result of the modification
  of the anterior portion of the central nervous system to form a complex brain, round which are
  concentrated the chief organs of special sense. This is combined with the evolution of a skull,
  which, in addition to providing a "cranium" for the enclosure and protection of the brain, and
  partial or complete capsules for the sense-organs, is connected behind with a system of bony or
  cartilaginous visceral arches, which loop round the pharynx between the gill-clefts. Besides
  supporting the breathing organs (gills) in the lower aquatic Craniata, or existing as embryonic
  vestiges in the higher lung-breathing forms, these arches usually form the basis of jaws for the
  mouth. The epidermal portion of the superficial skin is always composed of several layers of
  cells. The notochord, which is always present in the embryo, and in a few Craniates, both living
  and extinct, may even be retained in its entirety in the adult, fails to reach <span
  class="pagenum" id="page142"><span class="smaller">{142}</span></span>the anterior end of the
  brain. In most Craniates, however, the notochord becomes more or less completely replaced in the
  adult by the development round it of a series of vertebrae, forming the backbone or vertebral
  column. Two pairs of limbs, and cartilaginous or bony limb-girdles for their support, are very
  generally present.</p>

  <p>The segmentation, or serial repetition of certain organs of the body, which is so marked a
  feature in the Cephalochordata, is also characteristic of the Craniata. Examples of this may be
  seen in the division of the lateral longitudinal muscles of the body wall into muscle-segments or
  myotomes by a series of transverse fibrous septa; in the formation of the vertebral column by a
  series of successive joints or vertebrae; in a similar serial repetition of the cranial and spinal
  nerves, the gill-clefts and branchial arches, certain blood-vessels, and the renal tubules. There
  is sometimes, however, no precise regional or numerical correspondence between the different
  organs which are successively repeated in this way, and hence it is probable that, in at least
  some of the organs of the Craniate body, the segmentation has been independently evolved in each
  case.</p>

  <p>The pharynx is relatively much shorter than in other Chordata. The gill-clefts are few in
  number, whether, as in the lower Craniata, they are retained as the functional breathing organs,
  or are present, as vestiges only, in the embryos of the higher members of the group. In no
  instance are they subdivided by the growth of "tongue-bars" or "synapticula," nor do they open
  externally into an atrial or peribranchial cavity. The liver is a massive compound tubular gland,
  never, in the adult at all events, a simple caecal sac; and usually there is a pancreas and a
  spleen.</p>

  <p>A spacious epithelium-lined body cavity or coelom, which, as regards its origin, may be
  regarded as a "syncoelom,"<a id="NtA_117" href="#Nt_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> surrounds the
  alimentary canal and separates it from the body wall. From the epithelial walls of the coelom are
  derived the gonads (ovaries and testes), which in the adult are limited to a single pair; while
  paired and often segmentally-arranged lateral tubular outgrowths from it (renal tubuli) acquire a
  glandular character and form the basis of the excretory or kidney system. A special portion <span
  class="pagenum" id="page143"><span class="smaller">{143}</span></span>of the coelom also surrounds
  the heart and forms a pericardial cavity, and in some Craniata the genital ducts may be formed
  from its lining membrane.</p>

  <p>There is always a muscular heart, consisting of at least three chambers, a sinus venosus, an
  auricle and a ventricle, and formed by a modification of the initial portion of the ventral or
  cardiac aorta of the Cephalochordata. The disposition of the great blood-vessels is based on a
  common plan in all Craniata, and the blood which circulates in them is red in colour owing to the
  presence of red, haemoglobin-containing corpuscles in addition to the colourless leucocytes which
  alone are present in the Cephalochordata. Ductless blood-glands of various kinds (spleen, thyroid,
  thymus, inter- and ad-renal bodies) are very generally present, and modify in different ways the
  character of the blood as it circulates through them. Besides blood-vessels there is also a
  somewhat similar system of lymphatic vessels distributed throughout the organs and tissues of the
  body, which serves the purpose of re-collecting the fluid portion of the blood that has diffused
  from the blood-vessels for the nutrition of the tissues, and conveying it back to the blood
  vascular system. These lymphatics contain lymph, a fluid comparable to dilute blood plasma, in
  which leucocytes float. In addition to their continuity with the blood-vessels at certain points,
  the lymphatic vessels may also communicate with the coelom, and hence the Craniata must be
  included among those somewhat rare exceptions to the general rule that no connexion exists between
  the series of blood-containing channels and the coelom.</p>

  <p>In the excretory system the renal tubuli in the adult Craniata rarely retain their primitive
  embryonic communication with the coelom, and in no instance have they separate and independent
  external apertures; on the contrary, by the union of their outer or distal extremities, common
  efferent ducts are formed, which either open into a "cloaca," or directly on to the exterior of
  the body near the anus.</p>

  <p>In all Craniates the dorsally-placed and tubular central nervous system has its anterior
  portion enlarged and otherwise modified to form a "brain," while the remaining portion, retaining
  a simpler and more uniform structure, forms the spinal cord. In the embryo the brain always
  consists of three successive sac-like enlargements known as the fore-, mid-, and hind-brain, and
  from <span class="pagenum" id="page144"><span class="smaller">{144}</span></span>these are
  developed the various parts of the complex adult brain, which in the disposition and mutual
  relations of its parts conforms to a common plan in all the members of the group. There are at
  least ten pairs of cranial nerves having their origin from the brain, and, in addition, a varying
  number of spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord, and as a rule formed in each case by the
  union of a mainly sensory, ganglionated, dorsal root with a mainly motor, non-ganglionated,
  ventral root.</p>

  <p>The median and usually vestigial, parietal, or pineal eye may sometimes be retained as a
  functional organ, but there exist in all Craniates, in addition, paired eyes, the sensory portion
  of which, the retina, is derived as an outgrowth from the first of the primary embryonic
  brain-vesicles. To these organs of special sense are added a pair of auditory organs, and a pair
  of olfactory organs, besides, in the lower aquatic Craniates, the peculiar sensory organs of the
  "lateral line."</p>

  <p>The gonads are reduced to a single pair in the adult, although it is possible that they may
  have a multiple origin in the embryo. Gonoducts for the discharge of the sex-cells are almost
  invariably present, and may owe their origin either to a change of function on the part of certain
  kidney-ducts, or to independent evolution from the lining membrane of the coelom. The ova are
  generally provided with a large amount of nutritive reserve in the shape of food-yolk, and hence
  the process of segmentation is frequently partial or "meroblastic," but in some groups, in which
  the ova have less food-yolk, it is complete or "holoblastic." The typical invaginate gastrula
  stage, which is so striking a feature in the embryonic history of the lower Chordata, occurs also
  in a few of the lower Craniates, but in most of them it is apt to become masked or modified in
  various ways by the presence of a superabundant amount of food-yolk.</p>

  <p>Functional hermaphroditism is of very rare occurrence in Craniates, and, as in the
  Cephalochordata, reproduction by budding and the formation of colonies are unknown.</p>

  <p>Thus distinguished from other Chordata, the Craniata are divided into six "classes," which may
  be variously grouped, as the following table shows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Apart from the distinctive characters of the six "classes" into which the Craniata are divided,
  two or three of these classes may possess important structural features in common by which they
  are distinguished from others. Thus, Cyclostomata, Fishes and Amphibia agree with one another, and
  differ from all the remaining groups in breathing by gills and in possessing lateral line sensory
  organs during part, or the whole, of life. Their embryos have no investing amnion, neither does
  the sac-like outgrowth from the hind-gut, which is known as the allantois, if present at all, ever
  extend beyond the coelom to form an embryonic investment or to act as a primitive breathing organ.
  Hence, therefore, the terms Ichthyopsida, Anamniota, and Anallantoidea have been applied to these
  three classes. Similarly, the term Sauropsida, as applied to Reptiles and Birds, is a convenient
  means of giving expression to the fact that, underlying the most striking diversity of outward
  form and habits, there is a community of inward structure which justifies the conclusion that
  these animals are more closely related to one another than either group is to any other class of
  Craniates. And again, the application of the terms Agnathostomata and Gnathostomata brings into
  sharp relief the fundamental distinction between the Cyclostomata and all the remaining groups of
  Craniata which is <span class="pagenum" id="page146"><span class="smaller">{146}</span></span>only
  partially illustrated by the presence or absence of biting jaws.</p>

  <p>In a general and popular sense the Cyclostomata are usually regarded as "Fishes," but this
  usage rests on no better foundation than a certain agreement between the Cyclostomata and the true
  Fishes in outward form and habits, and in their method of respiration by gills. On the other hand,
  it has been maintained that the distinctive features of the Cyclostomata are of sufficient
  importance not merely to separate them from the true Fishes, but possibly even (as is to some
  extent expressed by the use of the terms Agnathostomata and Gnathostomata) to warrant their
  elevation to a group equal in taxonomic value to all the remaining living Craniata taken
  collectively. The organisms included in the Cyclostomata, the Lampreys, and especially the
  Hag-Fishes, exhibit in many respects an extremely low grade of Craniate structure; but how far the
  simplicity or archaic nature of some of their organs is primitive, or has been acquired through
  degeneration, it is difficult, and is sometimes impossible, to determine with any degree of
  satisfaction. In other respects, such as the presence of a rasping "tongue," it is obvious that
  the Cyclostomata have attained a high degree of specialisation. As one of several illustrations
  which might be given of difficulties of this kind, it may be mentioned that it is by no means
  certain that the Cyclostomata are not the degenerate descendants of primitive but now extinct
  Gnathostomata. At all events the presence of paired cartilages in the skull of the Lamprey, which,
  with some show of reason, may be regarded as representatives of the primitive upper and lower jaws
  of the latter group, would seem to suggest this conclusion. If this be correct, we must regard the
  formation of a suctorial buccal funnel, with its complex system of supporting cartilages&mdash;one
  of the most striking features in the structure of this animal&mdash;as a secondary and adaptive
  specialisation of a mouth originally provided with biting jaws. But in spite of such difficulties
  there can be no question that the Cyclostomata are the most primitive of all existing Craniates,
  and so far differ from the true Fishes and from all other classes of Craniate animals, that their
  inclusion in a class by themselves is the least that can be done to give graphic expression to
  their isolated position, even if we do not fully accept the dictum of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page147"><span class="smaller">{147}</span></span>Haeckel that "they are further removed from
  Fishes than Fishes from Man."</p>

  <p>Briefly stated, the Cyclostomata or Agnathostomata are distinguished from "Fishes" and all the
  remaining Craniata (Gnathostomata) by the following characters<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The mouth is either nearly terminal, as in the Hag-Fishes (<i>Myxine</i>); or, as in the
  Lampreys (<i>Petromyzon</i>), it opens out of a spacious, pre-oral, suctorial, buccal funnel,
  which, in its relations to the hypophysis or pituitary body, recalls the pre-oral buccal cavity of
  the Cephalochordata. As in Amphioxus, the hypophysis<a id="NtA_118"
  href="#Nt_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> is displaced dorsally by the forward growth of the pre-oral
  portion of the head in the embryo, and consequently it only attains its normal relations to the
  infundibular downgrowth<a id="NtA_119" href="#Nt_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a> from the ventral
  surface of the fore-brain by perforating the floor of the skull from above instead of from below
  as in all other Craniates. In one section of the group (e.g. <i>Myxine</i>) the hypophysis opens
  into the oral cavity, and serves as a tubular passage for the inspiratory water-current to the
  gill-sacs, a feature in which these Cyclostomes are unique. The apparently median olfactory organ
  is carried inwards with the hypophysial involution, and communicates with the latter throughout
  life. A primitive upper jaw (palato-quadrate cartilages or sub-ocular arches) is present, and in
  at least some Cyclostomes (<i>e.g.</i> the Lampreys), and possibly in all, there are structures
  which very probably represent a primitive lower jaw (Meckel's cartilages); but such structures are
  always non-biting, and merely form skeletal supports for other portions of the skull. In place of
  biting jaws the mouth is provided with a complex rasping lingual apparatus supported by special
  cartilages, the so-called tongue, which bears horny teeth and is capable of protrusion and
  retraction. Paired limbs are entirely wanting.</p>

  <p>In the Gnathostomata, on the contrary, there is no buccal funnel, and the mouth, whether
  terminal or ventral in position, opens directly outwards. The hypophysis is usually carried
  inwards with the stomatodaeal invagination which in the embryo gives rise to the mouth, and is
  therefore from the first in relation with the ventral surface of the brain. Biting jaws
  (palato-quadrate and Meckelian cartilages), formed by the modification of an anterior and
  primitively gill-bearing visceral arch, are <span class="pagenum" id="page148"><span
  class="smaller">{148}</span></span>invariably present. The olfactory organs are obviously paired,
  and they are distinct from the hypophysis. Paired limbs are present.</p>

  <p>As previously stated, the true Fishes form the second of the six "classes" into which the
  Craniata are divided. As compared with the higher Craniata, their distinctive characters may be
  concisely stated as follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Fresh water or marine Gnathostomata, which in their shape and in method of breathing are
  adapted for an aquatic life. Throughout life their respiratory organs are in the form of vascular
  processes (gills) derived from the walls of the branchial clefts, and supported by a series of
  branchial arches. The principal organ of locomotion is the powerful muscular tail; in addition,
  however, there are paired fins, pectoral and pelvic, corresponding to the fore- and hind-limbs of
  the terrestrial Craniata, and possessing a supporting cartilaginous or bony skeleton
  ("ichthyopterygium") which cannot readily be compared with the limb-skeleton of the latter. Fishes
  also possess a system of median fins, supported by a special skeleton of their own. An exoskeleton
  of dermal spines or denticles, scales or bony plates, is usually present. Except in one group, the
  Dipnoi, the heart has but one auricle, and receives only venous blood, which it forces, first,
  through the blood-vessels of the gills, and thence, as arterial blood, through the vessels of the
  body generally. An air-bladder is frequently present, and serves as a hydrostatic organ or float,
  but in a few cases it may act as a lung, and helps the gills in the work of respiration. The
  paired olfactory organs rarely communicate with the oral cavity by internal nostrils. Peculiar
  cutaneous sense-organs are disposed in linear tracts along the sides of the body (lateral line
  sensory organs), and on the head, and appear to be specially associated with a life in water.</p>

  <p>Fishes may be divided into the following "sub-classes," and these in turn may be subdivided
  into various "orders" and "sub-orders"<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  allies; and the Teleostei. Living Ganoids agree with one another, and differ from Teleosts in
  possessing an intestinal spiral valve and a conus arteriosus. It is difficult, however, to
  separate the two groups, inasmuch as in each group there are living forms which tend to
  approximate to the other; and numerous fossil genera, of whose soft parts nothing is known, are in
  many respects intermediate between the two. The position and relationships of the
  Palaeospondylidae, Ostracodermi, Antiarchi, and Arthrodira are very uncertain. The
  Palaeospondylidae have been included in the Cyclostomata, or at all events have been regarded as
  more or less closely related to that group, while the absence of paired fins and the apparent want
  of jaws have suggested that the Ostracodermi occupy an intermediate position between the
  Cyclostomata and the Gnathostomata.<a id="NtA_120" href="#Nt_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> On the

  <i>Lepidosiren</i>, and their extinct allies.</p>

  <p>In all the Cyclostomata the body is Eel-like in shape, the head and trunk being nearly
  cylindrical, and the tail somewhat flattened from side to side. In <i>Petromyzon</i> the head
  terminates in a ventrally-directed, funnel-like cavity&mdash;the buccal funnel&mdash;in the roof
  of which the relatively small mouth is situated (Fig. 91, A.). The margin of the funnel is fringed
  by a series of short papillae, <span class="pagenum" id="page151"><span
  class="smaller">{151}</span></span>but in the Hag-Fishes (<i>Myxine</i> and <i>Bdellostoma</i>),
  where a buccal funnel is not developed, longer tentacle-like structures are present on each side
  of the mouth. On the upper surface of the head is the single median nostril, or naso-pituitary
  aperture, placed between the eyes in the Lampreys (Fig. 91, B, C), but at the anterior margin of
  the head in <i>Myxine</i> and its allies (Fig. 92). In the living Lampreys a semi-transparent area
  of skin may be noticed behind the nasal organ, which coincides with the position of the more
  deeply-seated parietal eye. On each side of the body, commencing a short distance behind the eye,
  is a series of small and almost circular branchial clefts (<i>Petromyzon</i>, <i>Bdellostoma</i>).
  In <i>Myxine</i>, however, the clefts of each side have a single common external aperture,
  situated on the ventral side of the body and some distance behind the head (Fig. 92, A). At the
  junction of the trunk with the tail is the anus, behind which is the papilla which carries the
  urino-genital aperture at its extremity. There are no paired limbs or vestiges of such organs.
  Median fins are represented in the Lampreys by an anterior dorsal fin and a posterior dorsal fin,
  the latter being continuous with the caudal fin which fringes the upper and lower margins of the
  protocercal tail. In <i>Myxine</i> a caudal fin only is present, surrounding the extremity of the
  tail.</p>

  <p>In Fishes the characteristic shape of the body is more or less that of a spindle, tapering at
  each end and somewhat flattened from side to side; and, as a rule, the three regions of the
  body&mdash;head, trunk, and tail&mdash;pass almost imperceptibly into one another (Fig. 93, A).
  Nevertheless, there is great diversity of form in different Fishes. Compare, for example, the
  elongated, cylindrical shape of the Eels (which is perhaps associated with their habit of
  insinuating themselves into holes and crevices, and their undulatory, snake-like movements when
  swimming); the compressed, band-like shape of the Ribbon-Fishes (Trachypteridae); the flattened
  bodies of those Fishes which habitually live and move on the bottom, like the Skates and Rays; the
  thin, laterally-compressed bodies, often nearly as high as long, of the Flat-Fishes
  (Pleuronectidae), which always swim and rest on either the right or left side; the almost
  spherical Globe-Fishes (<i>Tetrodon</i>) which often float passively in the water; and the
  singular rectangular, coffin-like Coffer-Fishes (<i>Ostracion</i>). There is also much difference
  in the relative proportions of the three regions of the body in different Fishes, as witness the
  enormous size and <span class="pagenum" id="page153"><span
  class="smaller">{153}</span></span>grotesque appearance of the head of the Angler-Fish
  (<i>Lophius</i>); the huge high trunk and abbreviated tail of the Sun-Fish (<i>Orthagoriscus</i>);
  and the short high trunk and long tail of <i>Notopterus</i> (Fig. 334).</p>

  <p>In its external appearance the head perhaps differs more in different Fishes than any other
  part of the body. Long and flattened in the Skates and Rays, the head becomes short and high in
  most Holocephali and in many Teleosts, or is shaped like a blunt cone, as in such Dipnoi as
  <i>Protopterus</i> and <i>Lepidosiren</i>; or becomes long and pointed, as in the North American
  "Gar Pike" (<i>Lepidosteus</i>); or, finally, as in the Hammer-head Shark (<i>Sphyrna</i>), the
  head may be produced into great lateral extensions, carrying the eyes at their extremities (Fig.
  256, B). Apart from its relative shape and size, the appearance of the head may be further
  modified by the thinness of the investing scaleless skin, which readily allows the surface and
  contour lines of the bones of the skull to be seen through it, as in the Crossopterygii, and in
  such Teleosts as the Siluroid genera <i>Clarias</i> and <i>Callichthys</i>; or the skin, even if
  devoid of scales, may be so thick that scarcely any of the bones are visible externally. The
  exoskeleton, whether in the form of scales or bony plates, may extend to a varying degree on to
  the surface of the head in different Teleosts, or may even invest nearly the whole of the head.
  When, as is not infrequently the case (<i>e.g.</i> many Scorpaenidae) certain of the bones of the
  skull are produced into projecting spines, the head assumes a singularly formidable appearance
  (Fig. 424).</p>

  <p>The mouth differs greatly in size and position. In existing Elasmobranchs it is generally
  crescentic in shape and always ventral in position, but in certain primitive fossil members of the
  group, as in the Palaeozoic <i>Cladoselache</i>, it is anterior and terminal. The Sturgeon and
  other living Chondrostei have the mouth ventral. In the Dipnoi also the mouth is ventral, but is
  near the extremity of the snout. As a rule, the mouth is terminal or nearly so in the living
  Crossopterygii and Holostei, and in the great majority of Teleosts, although in the latter group
  it is occasionally distinctly ventral, especially when a snout is developed, and it may sometimes
  look upwards by reason of the projection of the lower jaw in front of the upper. A pronounced
  "beak" is sometimes formed by the forward prolongation of both jaws, as in the Gar Pike
  (<i>Lepidosteus</i>), with the result that the <span class="pagenum" id="page154"><span
  class="smaller">{154}</span></span>vertical gape of the mouth is greatly increased, but in a few
  Teleosts a beak may result from a forward extension of one jaw only, the upper in the Sword-Fish
  (<i>Xiphias</i>) and the lower in the "Half-Beak" (<i>Hemirhamphus</i>). A further modification is
  to be noted in many Teleosts, in which, owing to the forward prolongation and inclination of the
  skeletal supports of the jaws, the mouth is at the extremity of a longer or shorter spout-like
  beak, and is then usually very small. This is the case in the "Sea-Horse" (<i>Hippocampus</i>),
  the Pipe-Fishes (<i>Syngnathus</i>), the "Flute-mouths" (<i>Fistularia</i>), and the Trumpet-Fish
  (<i>Centriscus</i>), and especially in certain species of the African family Mormyridae, where the
  pore-like mouth is at the extremity of a long, tapering, downwardly-curved proboscis (Fig. 330).
  In many Teleosts the mouth can be protruded and withdrawn at will by a sliding motion of the bones
  of the upper jaw (premaxillae) on the anterior skull bones by which they are supported. From this
  point of view the toothless mouth of the Sturgeon is even more remarkable. By a forward or a
  backward swing of the elements which form the upper half of the hyoid arch (hyomandibular and
  symplectic) the mouth can be thrust downwards from the under side of the head like a spout, when
  the Fish is feeding, and subsequently retracted. In not a few Fishes the forepart of the head is
  prolonged forwards over the mouth and jaws in the form of a rostrum or "snout"; it is, in fact, to
  the growth of a snout that the ventral position of the mouth in Fishes is generally due. This
  feature is more or less characteristic of most Elasmobranchs, in which the snout forms a cut-water
  overhanging the mouth. In the Holocephali the snout is short and blunt, except in
  <i>Harriotta</i>, where it is pointed and unusually long. Among the Chondrostei the Sturgeon has
  an exceptionally massive snout, the length and shape of which differs in different species. In the
  allied <i>Polyodon</i> the thin, flattened, spoon-like snout is scarcely less than one-fourth the
  length of the body (Fig. 289).</p>

  <p>Simple or branched tactile filaments or "barbels" are present on different parts of the head in
  many Teleostomi, sometimes at or near the chin, as in certain Gadidae, like the Haddock and Cod,
  or on the under surface of the snout, in front of the mouth, as in the Sturgeon. In the Siluridae
  (Fig. 356), where they are found in relation with the upper and lower jaws, and even between the
  nostrils, these structures are often remarkably developed.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page155"><span class="smaller">{155}</span></span></div>

  <p>The eyes of Fishes are usually very large. They are generally situated on the sides of the
  head, but in the "Star-gazers" (<i>Uranoscopus</i>) they are on the upper surface and close
  together. In the goggle-eyed <i>Periophthalmus</i> the eyes seem to protrude from their orbits,
  and in a variety of a species of Carp, the Gold-Fish (<i>Cyprinus auratus</i>), the protrusion is
  so marked that the eyes seem as if on stalks. In a few species, which live either in caves or at
  very great oceanic depths, the eyes become vestigial, and are hidden beneath the skin, or are even
  covered by scales (Fig. 430).</p>

  <p>In the Elasmobranchs and Dipnoi the olfactory organs retain their primitive position as
  pit-like sacs on the ventral surface of the snout, just in front of the mouth. In the Dipnoi (e.g.
  <i>Protopterus</i>) each olfactory sac has two apertures, of which one, the external nostril, is
  placed on the under surface of the snout, while the other, the internal nostril, opens within the
  upper lip into the oral cavity&mdash;a feature which is unique among Fishes. In nearly all
  Teleostomi, also, each sac has two nostrils, which, however, are situated either on the upper
  surface or on the sides of the fore-part of the head, and have no communication with the
  mouth.</p>

  <p>Directly behind the head in Elasmobranchs, or beneath its hinder part in all other Fishes, are
  placed the external apertures of the branchial clefts. In the former group these apertures are
  visible externally in the form of a series of narrow vertical slits, but in the latter they
  communicate with the exterior by opening on each side into a common branchial cavity, the outer
  wall of which is formed by a movable flap-like fold with a free hinder margin and a special
  internal skeleton of cartilaginous rays or of bony plates and rods, the gill-cover or operculum
  (Fig. 161, B). Behind the free margin of the operculum there is a slit-like orifice, the
  gill-opening or external branchial aperture, which curves from above downward and forward toward
  the chin, and places the branchial cavity in communication with the exterior. Through this
  aperture the water, which has entered through the mouth, traversed the gill-clefts, and bathed the
  gills, finds its exit from the body. The space on the ventral side of the head between the two
  halves of the lower jaw, and between the two external branchial apertures, is termed the
  "isthmus." The size of the external branchial aperture differs greatly in different Fishes,
  according to the extent to which the <span class="pagenum" id="page156"><span
  class="smaller">{156}</span></span>free opercular margin fuses below with the isthmus, or behind
  with the side of the head. Thus the aperture may extend from the chin in front upward and backward
  to near the dorsal surface of the head, or it may be reduced to little more than a mere pore
  situated on any part of the opercular edge (e.g. <i>Hippocampus</i>); or, as in
  <i>Symbranchus</i>, the reduced pores of opposite sides may coalesce in the floor of the throat in
  a common median opening.</p>

  <p>In the Elasmobranchs and in the Dipnoi the cloacal aperture is always situated at the junction
  of the trunk with the tail. In the Teleostomi, however, where the intestine has a separate
  external orifice or anus, distinct from, and placed in front of, the separate or combined
  urino-genital ducts, the anus may either retain its primitive position near the union of the trunk
  and tail, or occupy almost any intermediate position between this point and the throat.</p>

  <p>Most Fishes possess both median and paired fins (Fig. 93, A). From an evolutionary point of
  view the median fins have a far greater antiquity than the paired fins. They appear before the
  latter in embryonic development, and in the Cephalochordata, and such lower Craniates as the
  Cyclostomata, they are the only fins which exist. The isolated median fins of most Fishes are
  discontinuous remnants of a primitively continuous structure, which, extending like a fringe along
  the median line of the back, was thence continued round the end of the tail and forward along the
  ventral surface as far as the cloacal or anal orifice. This primitive condition, which, as we have
  seen, is characteristic of Amphioxus, is also very general in the embryos and larvae of Fishes
  (Figs. 238 and 309), and is more or less completely retained in the Dipnoi and in many adult
  Teleosts, notably in those species in which the body is greatly elongated and locomotion is
  effected by serpentine lateral undulations, as in the Eels (Anguillidae), and in others which,
  either through their quasi-parasitic or commensal habit (e.g. <i>Fierasfer acus</i>), or by reason
  of a peculiar environment, as in certain deep-sea Fishes (Fig. 430) are distinguished by the
  retention of many larval features. More generally, however, the continuity of the fin becomes
  interrupted, and that portion of it which surrounds the extremity of the tail is the first to
  become separated from the rest as a caudal fin (Fig. 429). By further interruptions the remaining
  dorsal portion may become divided into two or three isolated <span class="pagenum"
  id="page157"><span class="smaller">{157}</span></span>dorsal fins (Fig. 398), or even into a
  series of isolated finlets; and similarly also with the ventral portion or anal fin; or, without
  undergoing subdivision, both fins may become reduced in length to an extent which differs greatly
  in different Fishes, and persist as single dorsal or anal fins. But even when a median fin is
  reduced in length by atrophy, or becomes subdivided by breaches in its continuity, the externally
  invisible supporting radial elements frequently remain to prove the originally greater length of
  the fin, or the continuity of its detached remnants.</p>

  <p>Like the median fins, the paired fins may also be regarded as discontinuous remnants of an
  originally continuous <i>lateral</i> fin which extended along each side of the body from the head
  to the vent, and of which only the anterior and posterior portions now remain as the pectoral and
  pelvic fins. Pectoral fins are rarely absent in existing Fishes, and when present they are always
  situated just behind the branchial clefts, where, as in most Teleostomi, the outline of their
  supporting pectoral girdle can often be seen. They vary greatly in form and size in different
  Fishes, and in the Elasmobranchs are larger than in most others. In certain members of the latter
  group, the Skates and Rays, in which the feebly-developed tail is probably useless as a locomotor
  organ, the pectoral fins are exceptionally large, forming broad triangular lobes, the broad bases
  of which are continuous with the sides of the body from the anterior part of the head to near the
  origin of the pelvic fins, and thus in outward form, if not in inward structure, simulate
  re-acquired continuous lateral fins. Except in a few instances, the Teleostomi have relatively
  small fan-shaped or paddle-like pectoral fins, and usually only that portion of each fin which is
  supported by the dermal fin-rays is visible externally. In the Crossopterygii, however, each fin
  appears to consist of a central lobe invested by scales and encircled by a peripheral fringe of
  fin-rays, and is hence described as a "lobate" fin (Fig. 279). When the central lobe is much
  increased in length but reduced in width the fin becomes acutely lobate. A similar type of fin is
  present in the Dipnoi, but in <i>Protopterus</i> and <i>Lepidosiren</i>, owing to the length and
  narrowness of the central lobe, and the reduction or suppression of the marginal fringe, the
  pectoral members assume the condition of long tapering filaments (Fig. 304).</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page158"><span class="smaller">{158}</span></span></div>

  <p>Although as a rule smaller in size, the pelvic fins bear a general resemblance to the pectoral
  fins, but in certain groups, especially in Teleosts, they are liable to undergo extraordinary
  changes in position, and, as will be seen presently, are much more prone to exhibit the effects of
  adaptive modification and degeneration. They are present in all existing Fishes, with the
  exception of the Crossopterygian <i>Calamichthys</i> and some Teleosts, and, except in the
  Teleostei, they invariably retain their primitive position near the junction of the trunk with the
  tail, and directly in front of the cloacal or the anal aperture; in this position they are said to
  be "abdominal." In other Teleostei the fins undergo forward displacement and come to lie directly
  beneath the pectorals (Fig. 415), when they are said to be "thoracic," as in the Mackerels
  (Scombridae) and the Horse-Mackerels (Carangidae); or even in front of the pectoral fins on the
  under surface of the throat, when they are described as "jugular," as in the Cod and other Gadidae
  (Fig. 398).</p>

  <p>Both the median and the paired fins are supported by an internal skeleton, consisting (i.) of a
  series of cartilaginous or bony, rod-like radial elements or pterygiophores, for the support of
  the inner or proximal portion of the fins, and (ii.) of a series of horny fibres, or bony dermal
  fin-rays, which fulfil a like function for the outer or distal portion. The radial elements,
  however, are never visible externally, even when, as in most Elasmobranchs, they support the
  greater part of the fins, inasmuch as they are invested by the fin-muscles and the skin; and in
  the same group, where horny fibres complete the fin-skeleton, they too are covered by the spinose
  skin, and hence offer no external evidence of their existence. In the Teleostomi a marked
  reduction in the number and length of the radial elements of the paired fins, and the insinking of
  those pertaining to the median fins into the adjacent muscles of the body-wall, leaves the dermal
  fin-rays, with their thin covering of transparent and usually scaleless skin, as obvious features
  in the external appearance of the Fish, and apparently as the sole support of the fins.</p>

  <p>The dermal fin-rays of the Teleostomi exhibit an obvious distinction into spines and soft rays
  (Fig. 93, A). The former are stout, rigid, and unbranched structures, pointed at their free distal
  ends, which, in numbers differing in different genera and species, support the anterior portions
  of the dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins. <span class="pagenum" id="page159"><span
  class="smaller">{159}</span></span>Soft rays are flexible, branched distally, and generally
  exhibit a transversely-jointed structure; when present in conjunction with spines they invariably
  lie behind the latter. The presence of both kinds of fin-rays, or of soft rays only, is one of the
  more obvious distinctions between the Teleostean groups of the Acanthopterygii and the
  Malacopterygii, of which the Perch and the Salmon respectively are well-known examples. Powerful
  spines are frequently developed in front of the dorsal fin in many living and extinct
  Elasmobranchs, and, under the general term of "ichthyodorulites," constitute the sole fossil
  remains of many extinct Devonian and Carboniferous genera.</p>

  <p>The caudal fin and the terminal portion of the tail exhibit interesting modifications which are
  highly characteristic of particular groups of Fishes. In the embryonic and early larval stages of
  most Fishes the tapering caudal extremity retains its coincidence with the axis of the body, and
  divides the caudal fin into two equal portions, a dorsal and a ventral lobe, the two being
  continuous round the tip of the tail; and this condition, which is certainly the most primitive,
  is termed "protocercal" or "diphycercal" (Figs. 238 and 309). Such a symmetrical tail, as we have
  seen, is retained in the Cyclostomata, and was also present in certain extinct palaeozoic Sharks
  (e.g. <i>Pleuracanthus</i>), but it may be doubted if any existing Fish has a tail which is truly
  and primitively diphycercal. The Dipnoi (Fig. 304) and the Crossopterygii, including fossil
  representatives of both groups, and perhaps a few Teleosts, seem to approach this condition; but
  it is by no means certain that the apparent symmetry is primitive, and has not been secondarily
  acquired. In other Fishes the terminal part of the tail, including also its section of the
  vertebral column, is bent upwards, and is fringed along its upper border by the reduced dorsal
  lobe of the caudal fin, which, nevertheless, retains its continuity with the ventral lobe round
  the tip of the tail. The latter, or rather its hinder portion, is strongly developed, but, owing
  to the prolongation of the up-tilted caudal axis beyond it, the dorsal lobe appears longer than
  the ventral, and hence there is a marked want of symmetry between the upper and lower division of
  the caudal fin (Fig. 253, A). The Ostracodermi, all living and nearly all extinct Elasmobranchs,
  the Acanthodei, Holocephali, some extinct Dipnoi, and amongst the Teleostomi, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page160"><span class="smaller">{160}</span></span>the living Chondrostei and
  certain extinct Crossopterygii, afford examples of this unsymmetrical or heterocercal type of
  tail. A third type is the "homocercal." In this type the caudal fin appears externally as if
  perfectly symmetrical, the supporting fin-rays radiating from the blunt extremity of the tail in
  such a way that a prolongation of the axis of the body appears to divide the fin into equal-sized
  and continuous upper and lower lobes (Fig. 343). Dissection, however, reveals the fact that the
  terminal portion of the vertebral column is bent upwards as in the heterocercal tail, and that
  while the dorsal lobe is almost vestigial, the ventral lobe is enormously developed, and its
  supporting rays so inclined backwards parallel to the axis of the body as to form practically the
  whole of the caudal fin, with the exception of the dorsal border, which is formed by the few
  remaining fin-rays of the dorsal lobe (Fig. 140). A homocercal tail, therefore, is a disguised or
  masked heterocercal tail. It is specially characteristic of Teleosts, and is closely approached in
  the Holostean genera <i>Lepidosteus</i> (Fig. 299) and <i>Amia</i>, which offer an interesting
  transition from the heterocercal to the homocercal types; and, singularly enough, even the
  heterocercal tail of the Palaeozoic Shark <i>Cladoselache</i> (Fig. 249), seems as if it had
  undergone some degree of independent specialisation in the same direction. The homocercal tail
  exhibits much diversity of form in different Teleosts, sometimes being rounded or lancet-shaped,
  and sometimes having a deeply-forked hinder margin. One of the Ribbon-Fishes, <i>Trachypterus
  taenia</i>, is singular in having the caudal fin on the dorsal side of the tip of the tail, and
  directed upwards like a fan. In some Teleosts, again, there is no recognisable upward deflection
  of the terminal portion of the vertebral axis, and the caudal fin-rays seem to be derived in equal
  proportions from the dorsal and ventral lobes of the fin (Fig. 414). This apparently diphycercal
  tail is probably a secondary acquisition, and may be considered due to the atrophy of the terminal
  portion of the vertebral column, and the subsequent coalescence of the dorsal and ventral lobes of
  the caudal fin round the extremity of a more or less abbreviated tail. It is even possible that in
  some Fishes the proper caudal fin has completely atrophied, and that the apparent caudal fin has
  really been formed by a similar modification affecting the hinder portions of the dorsal and anal
  fins. In the extinct Crossopterygian genera, <i>Coelacanthus</i>, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page161"><span class="smaller">{161}</span></span><i>Diplurus</i>, and <i>Undina</i> (Fig.
  278), there is evidence that the latter modification has actually taken place, for the atrophying
  terminal part of the tail, with a vestige of the original caudal fin, is still retained as an
  axial prolongation between and even beyond the secondarily formed caudal fin. To this secondary
  diphycercal tail the term "gephyrocercal" has been applied. The apparent diphycercal tail of many
  Fishes, and especially of Teleosts, is really a gephyrocercal structure. The ancestral evolution
  of the different types of caudal fin is recapitulated in the embryonic histories of their
  possessors. The heterocercal condition of an adult Fish is always preceded by a transitory
  embryonic diphycercal stage: from the same starting-point the homocercal condition is attained
  after passing through a heterocercal stage; while the gephyrocercal may perhaps be derived by
  degeneration from any one of the others.</p>

  <p>The normal function of the fins, both median and paired, has reference to locomotion in the
  form of progression, steering or balancing, but in not a few Fishes the fins may be variously
  modified and adapted for quite different purposes; and especially is this the case in the dominant
  group of existing Fishes&mdash;the Teleostei. Thus, to quote a few examples, the first dorsal fin
  of the Sucker-Fishes (<i>Remora</i>, <i>Echeneis</i>) forms a cephalic sucker, by means of which
  the Fish attaches itself to Sharks and Turtles (Fig. 421); or, as in the Angler-Fish
  (<i>Lophius</i>), its anterior rays are much elongated, and terminate in lobes which serve as a
  bait to attract the prey on which the animal feeds; again, in some of the deep-sea Fishes the
  dorsal fin, like the pectoral and caudal fins in others of a similar habitat, is produced into
  long trailing filaments whose use is probably tactile. The pelagic young of many Teleosts, such as
  some of the Ribbon-Fishes and the Horse-Mackerels (<i>Caranx</i>), also have certain of their
  fin-rays prolonged into similar filaments. The pectoral fins are enormously elongated and
  wing-like in the Flying-Fishes (<i>Exocoetus</i>), and, after the fashion of a parachute, serve to
  sustain the Fish in its flying leaps through the air. They are also similarly modified for a like
  purpose in the so-called Flying-Gurnard (<i>Dactylopterus volitans</i>). The pectoral fins may
  also be used for progression on land, as in the African and East Indian Goby
  (<i>Periophthalmus</i>), where the fins are large and muscular and are applied to the ground like
  feet, enabling <span class="pagenum" id="page162"><span class="smaller">{162}</span></span>the
  Fish to hop about the muddy or sandy flats left bare by the retreating tide, in pursuit of the
  small Crustaceans on which it feeds. In other Teleosts certain of the rays of the pectoral fin
  separate from the rest and from one another, and form free tentacle-like structures the use of
  which is probably tactile. In the Gurnards these organs are relatively short and stout, but in
  other Fishes they may form long slender filaments twice as long as the animal, and capable of
  being moved independently of the fin, as in the West African and West Indian species of
  Polynemidae (<i>Pentanemus quinquarius</i>). Similar free rays are also present in some deep-sea
  Scopelidae, as in <i>Bathypterois dubius</i>, where they are nearly as long as the Fish itself
  (Fig. 371, B). A familiar modification of the pelvic fins in several Teleosts is their coalescence
  and more or less complete conversion into a ventrally-placed sucker-like organ of attachment, as
  in the common Lump-Sucker (<i>Cyclopterus</i>) and the Gobies (<i>Gobius</i>). In the gaudy
  Chilian Fish, <i>Sicyases sanguineus</i> (Fig. 428), the anterior part of a huge ventral sucker is
  supported by the jugular pelvic fins, and the hinder part by prolongations from the pectoral
  girdle. Certain Cyprinidae (e.g. <i>Gastromyzon</i>, which frequents the rapidly-flowing mountain
  streams of Borneo), have the whole ventral surface of the trunk, in conjunction with the outwardly
  and horizontally directed pectoral and pelvic fins, modified to form an efficient adhesive surface
  for attaching the Fish to the stones and rocks of the river bottom<a id="NtA_121"
  href="#Nt_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a> (Fig. 355). In the males of Elasmobranchs, except in the
  Palaeozoic Shark <i>Cladoselache</i>, and of Holocephali, the hinder portions of the pelvic fins
  are modified to form copulatory organs, the claspers, mixipterygia, or pterygopodia. Lastly, it
  may be mentioned that the spines, often long, pointed, and sometimes serrated, with which the
  paired and median fins of many Fishes are provided, furnish formidable offensive or defensive
  organs, especially when they are associated with poison glands, and also that in by no means an
  inconsiderable number of Teleosts the spines may form part of a stridulating vocal mechanism.</p>

  <p>In different Fishes the pectoral and pelvic fins and the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page163"><span class="smaller">{163}</span></span>median fins may, individually, all be absent
  through atrophy. The pectoral fins are rarely absent: nevertheless, in certain species of
  Syngnathidae, and in most Muraenidae, for example, these fins are entirely wanting. The pelvic
  fins are much less constant and are often absent in entire families, as in the Pipe-Fishes
  (Syngnathidae), the "Electric Eels" (Gymnotidae), and the true Eels (Anguillidae), and in the
  Globe-Fishes and Porcupine-Fishes (<i>Tetrodon</i>, <i>Diodon</i>), as well as in certain genera
  of families where they are usually present, as in some of the Blennies (Blenniidae) and in the
  Ophidiidae. Even when present the pelvic fins are often reduced to mere vestiges in the shape of
  filaments, as in some of the Gadoids (Gadidae) and Ribbon-Fishes, or are represented only by a
  pair of defensive spines, as in some Sticklebacks (<i>Gastrosteus</i>), or even by a single spine
  (Balistidae). Complete suppression of the pelvic fins, or their reduction to vestigial remnants,
  seems to be of frequent occurrence in Fishes which live in the mud, or are able to pass a longer
  or shorter time in soil periodically dried during the hot season, as in some Cyprinodontidae, and
  in species of such tropical Teleostean families as the Ophiocephalidae, Galaxiidae, and Siluridae.
  Suppression of the dorsal fin is apparent in the Gymnotidae, and of the anal fin in the
  Ribbon-Fishes. In some of the latter family, as in the rare British visitor the Oar-Fish
  (<i>Regalecus banksii</i>), and in the Sea-Horse (<i>Hippocampus</i>), where the tail becomes a
  prehensile organ for coiling round seaweeds when the animal is not swimming, the otherwise
  remarkably constant caudal fin is absent.</p>

  <p>An initial stage in the degeneration of median fins is to be seen in many of the Salmonidae and
  Siluridae, in which a posterior division of the dorsal fin becomes reduced in size, loses its fin
  rays, acquires much fat in its substance, and becomes an "adipose fin."</p>

  <p class="sp3">The "lateral line" is a notable feature in the external appearance of most Fishes.
  Originally developed in the superficial epidermis of the skin in the form of linear tracts of
  isolated and often segmentally arranged masses of sense-cells, these organs subsequently become
  imbedded for protection in the epidermic lining of either an open groove or a closed canal
  extending along each side of the trunk and tail, and prolonged on to the more exposed parts of
  each side of the head in the shape of a more <span class="pagenum" id="page164"><span
  class="smaller">{164}</span></span>complex system of branching grooves or of deeply-seated and
  externally inconspicuous canals. The course of the lateral line can, as a rule, readily be
  detected by the naked eye, and, even when not otherwise distinguishable, may be traced by the
  series of simple or multiple pores through which, at intervals, the canal communicates with the
  exterior (Fig. 93, A), and often also, in the trunk and tail, by a band of coloration different to
  that of the rest of the body.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Coloration.</b></p>

  <p>Contrary to popular opinion, it may be doubted if any animals, even Insects or Birds, can vie
  with living Fishes in the brilliancy and changeability of their colours. The nature of their
  habitat, the rapid fading of the natural tints after death, and the fact that museum specimens,
  however carefully preserved, afford but a ghostly resemblance to the colours of the living animal,
  account, no doubt, for much of the prevalent ignorance of the extraordinary extent to which
  colour-development may proceed in a considerable number of Fishes. Like the generality of northern
  forms of life, the Fishes of our own seas, rivers and lakes, are less conspicuous for vivid and
  striking coloration than those of tropical or subtropical climes, although such familiar
  Teleostean Fishes of our seas and fresh waters as the Mackerel, the Salmon and Trout, the males of
  the Stickleback and Dragonet, some of the Gurnards (Triglidae) and Wrasses (Labridae), the Opah or
  King-Fish (<i>Lampris luna</i>), and many others, are notable exceptions. Brilliancy of coloration
  is most conspicuous in the Teleostei: in nearly all other Fishes the colours are more uniform,
  usually sober and often sombre, with no more variety than is afforded by the presence of dark
  spots or bands on a lighter ground, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, or by the lighter colour of the ventral
  as compared with the dorsal surface. In Teleosts all the resources of colour-formation,
  pigmentation, reflection, and iridescence through optical interference, in diverse combinations,
  are employed in the production of the various tints, while the dominant ground colour is often
  diversified by the presence of stripes, bands or bars, longitudinal or transverse, or of spots of
  different hues, frequently arranged in striking and intricate patterns.</p>

  <p>The possibilities of coloration in these Fishes may be briefly illustrated by a few
  examples<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page165"><span class="smaller">{165}</span></span></div>

  <p>In an Australian Fish (<i>Plectropoma richardsoni</i>) the prevalent ground colour of the body
  is a brilliant carmine, with a tendency to yellow beneath, and diversified on the back and sides
  with ultramarine spots of almost sapphire-like intensity.<a id="NtA_122"
  href="#Nt_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a> Certain Australian species of <i>Beryx</i> (<i>B. affinis</i>
  and <i>B. m&uuml;lleri</i>)<a id="NtA_123" href="#Nt_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> have a similar
  ground-colour when freshly caught, but with various opalescent tints, chiefly blue and lilac
  reflections. In <i>Polynemus vereker</i><a id="NtA_124" href="#Nt_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> the
  ground colour is chrome yellow, with darker markings, the pectoral and caudal fins are bright
  orange, the remaining fins being a lighter shade of the same tint, and by contrast the long free
  filaments of the pectoral fins are a bright vermilion red. The Velvet-Fish (<i>Holoxenus
  cutaneus</i>), also a denizen of Australian seas, has a dominant colour of brilliant scarlet
  vermilion, or a mixture of vermilion and orange. The skin has no scales and presents a singular
  pilose or velvety appearance.<a id="NtA_125" href="#Nt_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> It is, however,
  in some of the Pacific Trigger-Fishes (e.g. <i>Monacanthus</i>) and Coffer-Fishes (species of
  <i>Ostracion</i>) that the eccentricities of coloration are perhaps most strikingly manifest, for
  not only are the prevailing colours of the most brilliant description, but the presence of
  differently coloured bands or stripes, often arranged in complex patterns, adds greatly to the
  gorgeous and singularly bizarre appearance of these Fishes. To quote one illustration, the male of
  the Tasmanian Coffer-Fish (<i>Ostracion ornatus</i>)<a id="NtA_126"
  href="#Nt_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> has the back and sides of its body grass-green and its belly
  pale lemon: the caudal fin is orange-yellow, and the remaining fins a neutral transparent tint.
  The sides of the trunk and head are traversed by broad, irregular, and somewhat interrupted bands
  of the most brilliant ultramarine blue, the edges of which are sharply defined by dark
  chocolate-brown lines. Two or three of the blue body-bands are continued on to the caudal fin,
  where they curl into characteristic loop-like patterns. The lemon-yellow of the belly is further
  variegated by a reticulated pattern in pale blue. In the female, formerly regarded as a distinct
  species, the ground colour is not green but a pale pinkish-grey, or dove-colour, with local
  flushes of a more decided pink, and the belly is a pure yellow. The blue stripes of the male are
  represented in the female by comparatively unbroken bands of a rich reddish-brown which, at the
  bases of the pectoral and dorsal fins, <span class="pagenum" id="page166"><span
  class="smaller">{166}</span></span>form an irregular spiral pattern. In both sexes the pattern of
  the longitudinal bands is never precisely the same in any two individuals. Scarcely less brilliant
  is the coloration of those Teleosts, notably species of Pomacentridae and Chaetodontidae, which
  frequent the coral reefs of the East Indian Archipelago and the Pacific and feed on the coral
  polypes, and of many of the Wrasses (Labridae). Many other groups, such, for example, as the
  Percidae, Cirrhitinae, and the Pipe-Fishes (Syngnathidae), include species in which the coloration
  is vivid and often beautiful, although less striking than is the case with the Fishes mentioned
  above. As illustrating the opposite extreme in the scale of coloration, between which and the
  brilliant tints just described every conceivable gradation exists, mention may be made of the
  colourless appearance of those Fishes which, like the Kentuckian Blind-Fish (<i>Amblyopsis
  spelaea</i>), are denizens of subterranean rivers; and, omitting a few species in which the
  coloration is almost brilliant, the prevalent sombre tints, dark brown or black, rarely relieved
  by spots, bands, or other distinctive markings, of the Fishes inhabiting the abyssal waters of the
  deep sea.</p>

  <p>The coloration of Fishes is due to the presence in the dermic portion of the skin of (<i>a</i>)
  special pigment-containing cells (colour-sacs, chromoblasts or chromatophores), and (<i>b</i>) a
  peculiar reflecting tissue composed of iridocytes.<a id="NtA_127"
  href="#Nt_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> Chromatophores are probably branched connective-tissue cells
  in which pigments of various colours are deposited. The colouring matter present in different
  chromatophores is red, orange, and yellow, all of which belong to the lipochrome group of
  pigments, or black (melanin group), but by the combination or blending of differently-coloured
  chromatophores other colours may be produced. Thus, green results from the mixing of yellow and
  black in suitable proportions; brown from the blending of yellow and black; and other shades or
  tints from an appropriate mixture of chromatophores of various colours. As a rule the muscles of
  Fishes contain but little haemoglobin, but, when visible through the skin, the occasional presence
  of this substance in localised patches may contribute a few red spots to the general coloration,
  as is the case in the British Flat-Fish <i>Lepidorhombus megastoma</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page167"><span class="smaller">{167}</span></span></div>

  <p>Iridocytes consist of guanin, which, in its chemical reactions, closely resembles the guanin
  obtained from guano, and therefore is to be regarded as a further illustration of the utilisation
  of waste excretion products for the production of colour in animals. In forming iridocytes the
  guanin is deposited in the shape of granules, or of rounded, polygonal, or stellate bodies, or in
  flattened plates. Considered as an agent in the production of colour, the chief feature in the
  iridocytes is their opacity and great reflecting power; and according to the way in which light is
  reflected from them, the result may be a chalky white or a bright silvery appearance. By
  interference these colour elements are also responsible for the prismatic colours and brilliant
  iridescence which so many Fishes exhibit. The optical properties of guanin has led to its use in
  the manufacture of artificial pearls. "Essence d'orient," or "blanc d'ablette,"<a id="NtA_128"
  href="#Nt_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a> from which these pearls are made, principally in Paris, is
  obtained from the scales of the Bleak (<i>Alburnus lucidus</i>), and is really the guanin of which
  the iridocytes of this Cyprinoid are composed. It is also to the presence of crystals of guanin
  that the beautiful metallic lustre of the iris in many Fishes is due.<a id="NtA_129"

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 94.</span>&mdash;The coloration elements in the skin of
      the upper side of a freshly-killed normal Flounder (<i>Pleuronectes flesus</i>), seen by
      transmitted light. The stellate black bodies are the black chromatophores; the grey bodies of
      similar shape represent the yellow chromatophores; and the small grey plates the iridocytes.
      (From Cunningham and MacMunn.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The chromatophores and iridocytes are chiefly disposed in two layers in the skin, one outside
  the scales and the other on the inner surface of the scales, between the latter and the underlying
  muscles; and although the two kinds of coloration elements may be present in both layers, their
  relative <span class="pagenum" id="page168"><span class="smaller">{168}</span></span>abundance
  varies in different Fishes, and in different parts of the surface of the same Fish. Where
  chromatophores are most abundant, usually on the back, the reflecting tissue is relatively scanty,
  and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. On the sides and belly of a Fish the place of the inner layer of the dorsal
  surface may be taken by the "argenteum." This layer is devoid of chromatophores, and consists of
  reflecting tissue in which the iridocytes form a continuous stratum, either in the form of
  granules, or as a close network of rod-like bodies or of polygonal plates in contact with one
  another, instead of being less numerous and more scattered as on the back. When iridescence is
  produced, it is due to the iridocytes of the outer layer of the skin; the dead whiteness and
  silvery lustre, on the other hand, have their origin in the different ways in which incident light
  is reflected from the inner layer or argenteum.</p>

  <p>To the relative abundance of chromatophores, the kind of pigment they contain, and the manner
  in which they are distributed and blended, combined with the different reflecting properties, or
  the iridescence, of the iridocytes, are due the extraordinary wealth and variety of colour in
  Fishes.</p>

  <p>The part played by the different coloration elements in the production of the characteristic
  colours of different Fishes may be illustrated by two examples.<a id="NtA_130"
  href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the common Whiting (<i>Gadus merlangus</i>) the back of the Fish is a dark bluish-grey; the
  sides have a beautiful iridescence and silvery glitter, while the belly is very nearly a dead
  white. Briefly, these appearances are due to the fact that chromatophores (black and deep yellow)
  are most abundant on the back, less numerous on the sides, and wanting altogether on the belly;
  while the iridescence and silvery appearance of the sides are due to the iridescence of the
  iridocytes external to the scales, combined with the non-iridescent but highly reflective property
  of a layer of iridocytes internal to the scales; and the dead white of the belly to the different
  reflecting power of the argenteum, and the absence of chromatophores in that region.</p>

  <p>In the Mackerel (<i>Scomber scombrus</i>) the distribution of coloration elements is different,
  inasmuch as they are mainly situated in the deeper part of the skin, internal to the deciduous
  scales. The back is marked by the well-known alternating wavy bands <span class="pagenum"
  id="page169"><span class="smaller">{169}</span></span>of black and green; the sides gleam with the
  most brilliant iridescence, changing from silver to yellow or red gold, according to the angle at
  which the Fish is viewed. The black bands of the back are produced by the crowding together of
  black chromatophores and the diminished number of yellow; the green bands by an equal blending of
  yellow and black. Over the dorsal surface and sides of the Fish, where the coloured bands extend,
  there is also a reflecting layer external to the chromatophores, and to this layer is due the
  silvery reflection and iridescence. On the belly the disappearance of the chromatophores and the
  greater thickness and opacity of the argenteum account for the lighter colour and the diminished
  iridescence and silvery glitter of this part of the skin.</p>

  <p>Many Fishes are known to have the power of changing their colours, and in some the change is
  rapid. Such changes are due to incident light reflected from surrounding surfaces, acting through
  the visual organs and the nervous system on the differently coloured chromatophores. The latter
  are capable of contraction and expansion. Expansion of any particular kind of chromatophores is
  accompanied by a diffusion of their pigment&mdash;black, red, orange, or other colour as the case
  may be&mdash;and, according to the number and distribution of the chromatophores affected, the
  prevailing tint or tints of the whole body will be intensified, or only spots, bands, patches, or
  flushes of colour will be produced. Conversely, when chromatophores contract, they may shrink up
  to mere dots and bring about a diminution in the vividness of their respective colours, or even an
  alteration of colour, seeing that yellow chromatophores become orange when contracted, while
  orange or red appear brown or black. Colour changes of this kind may be artificially brought
  about. Experiments with Sticklebacks (<i>Gastrosteus</i>)<a id="NtA_131"
  href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a>, kept in glass dishes with a bottom of black or white tiles,
  have shown that the Fishes over the white tiles became partially bleached, while others with a
  background of black tiles retained their original coloration. Bleached Fishes exposed to the white
  tiles for a relatively short period (three to ten days) tend to regain their original colour when
  subsequently removed to a background of black tiles, but prolonged exposure to the former
  conditions (five to six weeks) seems to render the acquired light colour more or less permanent.
  <span class="pagenum" id="page170"><span class="smaller">{170}</span></span>The interior of a
  Minnow-can is sometimes painted white, so that the bait may assume a lighter colour, and thus
  become more conspicuous in the deeper and darker water where Perch and Pike abound. Hence the
  colour of a Fish may vary with its surroundings; and, as will shortly be shown, the capacity for
  producing such changes under natural conditions is of the greatest importance to Fishes in various
  ways.</p>

  <p>Change of coloration may take place through the development of new chromatophores under the
  influence of new conditions, and is then comparatively slow. Artificial illumination of the
  unpigmented white side of a Flounder (<i>Pleuronectes flesus</i>), by means of a mirror, induces
  the formation of chromatophores, and produces a coloration more or less closely resembling the
  upper pigmented side.<a id="NtA_132" href="#Nt_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> A similar change
  sometimes occurs as a natural variation, and is then usually associated with structural deformity
  in other respects.</p>

  <p>Coloration also varies with age, sex, ill-health, and even with the emotions. Young or immature
  Fishes are often marked by bands, bars, or blotches of colour (<i>e.g.</i> the Parr-marks of young
  Salmonidae), which, as they disappear when the Fish approaches the adult state, are perhaps
  residual traces of ancestral coloration; although, no doubt, change of habits and surroundings are
  sometimes responsible for such colour changes as are observable during growth. Conspicuous
  coloration is one of the most frequent of secondary sexual characters, the colours of the male
  being brighter than those of the female, particularly during the breeding season. A diminution of
  colour has been noticed in the artificially-induced pigmentation of the lower side of a Flounder
  when the Fish was suffering from partial suffocation owing to the temporary failure in the supply
  of fresh water, the normal colour returning when the deficiency had been remedied. A similar
  pallor was caused by fright when the same Fish was disturbed.<a id="NtA_133"
  href="#Nt_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> A nocturnal colour-change has been recorded in the Tasmanian
  Trumpeter (<i>Latris hecateia</i>).<a id="NtA_134" href="#Nt_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> In addition
  to the olive-green longitudinal bands which are always apparent, there are visible at night five
  broad, transversely-arranged, blackish bands. As illustrating the importance of vision in
  colour-changes, it may be mentioned that in a specimen of this Fish, living in a tank, which had
  been blinded, <span class="pagenum" id="page171"><span class="smaller">{171}</span></span>probably
  by a rat or a cat, the dark bands were permanently retained.</p>

  <p>Changes of coloration sometimes take place, which either have no discernible relation to age,
  condition, or surroundings, or are brought about by domestication; and in individuals of the same
  species there is often a wide range of colour-variation, which is sometimes, but not always,
  associated with particular localities. In some fresh-water Fishes a yellow colour may replace the
  original tint (xanthochroism). The usually dull greenish Tench (<i>Tinca vulgaris</i>)
  occasionally becomes a bright orange-yellow. Another Cyprinoid, the common Gold Fish (<i>Cyprinus
  auratus</i>), in its wild state in China is also a dull brown or green, but, when domesticated,
  assumes in the first year of its life a black colour (melanism), then a silvery hue, and finally
  the vivid ruddy golden colour of the adult; occasionally, but rarely, the Fish is an albino.</p>

  <p>The value of a particular coloration in Fishes, either as an aid to concealment and protection
  from enemies, or by enabling them to secure their prey, may now be illustrated by a few
  examples.</p>

  <p>As previously shown, the colours of Fishes may be artificially varied according to their
  surroundings. Changes of a similar kind occur naturally, and when they tend to assimilate the
  tints of the Fish to the prevalent hues of its surroundings, and consequently aid concealment, we
  have examples of what has been termed variable protective resemblance. Individuals of the same
  species vary in colour according to the opacity of the water they live in, becoming darker in
  muddy or peaty water, and brighter and lighter in shallower or clearer water. Trout caught in a
  stream with a gravelly or sandy bottom are lighter in colour than those obtained from a muddy
  stream, and it is well known that the same Fish changes colour as it passes from the one
  background to the other.<a id="NtA_135" href="#Nt_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> In a lake in County
  Monaghan, Ireland, the Trout are darker on that side which is bounded by a bog, but are of the
  beautiful and sprightly variety generally inhabiting rapid and sandy streams on the opposite side
  where the bottom is gravelly; and narrow as the lake is, the two kinds of Trout appear to confine
  themselves to their respective areas.<a id="NtA_136" href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> Trout
  obtained from a <span class="pagenum" id="page172"><span class="smaller">{172}</span></span>stream
  near Ivy Bridge have become much lighter since the pollution of the water by white china clay.<a
  id="NtA_137" href="#Nt_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a> As an illustration of the necessity of vision to
  such colour-changes, it may be mentioned that blind Fishes cannot vary their tint in this
  protective fashion. A blind Turbot living upon a light sandy bottom differed from its fellows in
  being much darker and more conspicuous. Dark Trout have been observed among their light-coloured
  brethren in a chalk stream in Hampshire, but the former were invariably blind, probably, as their
  larger size indicated, through age.<a id="NtA_138" href="#Nt_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Of other forms of protective resemblance, reference may be made to the bottom-feeding
  Flat-Fishes (Pleuronectidae), many of which have the upper surface of the body coloured with
  various shades of brown, speckled with black or light specks or blotches, in harmony with the
  prevailing tints of the sandy banks which usually form their feeding-ground. When disturbed these
  Fishes court concealment, and render themselves still less conspicuous by partially burying
  themselves in the sand. Many of the Skates and Rays, which have a white ventral surface, have the
  back mottled and coloured in accordance with the colour of the sea-bottom, but in this case it is
  possible that the advantage lies in enabling the Fish to secure passing prey by concealing its own
  whereabouts.</p>

  <p>Striking examples of protective coloration occur among the Pipe-Fishes and Sea-Horses
  (Syngnathidae), which usually frequent groves of <i>Zostera</i>, Fucoids, and other sea-weeds. A
  British species of Pipe-Fish (<i>Siphonostoma typhle</i>),<a id="NtA_139"
  href="#Nt_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> which lives among the blades of the sea-grass, <i>Zostera</i>,
  is olive-green in colour, and is a typical example of protective resemblance both in colour and in
  the slender elongated shape of the body. Similar protective resemblances are noticeable among the
  Sea-Horses, the coloration varying with the general hue of their environment of sea-weed; but the
  climax is certainly reached by the singular Australian species, <i>Phyllopteryx eques</i> (Fig.
  388).<a id="NtA_140" href="#Nt_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> In this Fish the skin is produced into
  numerous long, flattened, branched filaments, which are prolonged from the extremities of
  spine-like outgrowths of the dermal skeleton, and marked by alternate bands of brown and orange,<a
  id="NtA_141" href="#Nt_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> <span class="pagenum" id="page173"><span
  class="smaller">{173}</span></span>thus resembling both in shape and colour the fronds of the
  surrounding fucoids and other marine algae amongst which the Fish lives.</p>

  <p>Many of the Fishes frequenting the coral reefs of the East Indian and Pacific areas, especially
  those belonging to the Teleostean families Chaetodontidae and Pomacentridae, have a most brilliant
  and vivid coloration, frequently marked by bands or stripes of different tint. So far from
  rendering these Fishes unduly conspicuous, there can be little doubt that, by harmonising with the
  striking and varied colours of the anemone-like coral polypes, their coloration is distinctly
  protective; and it is interesting to note that similar colour-patterns have been independently
  reproduced in both families.<a id="NtA_142" href="#Nt_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> Even the
  reef-frequenting Flat-Fishes (Pleuronectidae) have the usually sombre upper surface ornamented by
  vivid colours and striking patterns.</p>

  <p>Pelagic Fishes, like the Herring, Mackerel, Flying-Fish (<i>Exocoetus</i>), and many others,
  often have the belly and sides silvery or white, and the back dark green, black, or steely blue.
  Seen from below against the light sky, or viewed from above against the background of the dark
  water, these Fishes would seem to be practically invisible to their predatory foes, whether Fishes
  or Birds, or at all events not easily detected.</p>

  <p>Coloration may not only be protective, but also aggressive, by helping to conceal the proximity
  of an animal from its prey; add to this some device for deceiving and attracting the prey, and we
  have an example of "alluring" coloration.<a id="NtA_143" href="#Nt_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As an example of coloration which is both aggressive and alluring, the Angler-Fish or
  Fishing-Frog (<i>Lophius piscatorius</i>) of our own coasts may be quoted. Naturally sluggish and
  inactive in its habits, and often using its muscular pectoral fins for crawling about the
  sea-bottom, the Angler-Fish usually hides itself in the sand or amongst sea-weeds, which it
  closely resembles in general colour. Curious branched tag-like processes of soft skin fringe the
  sides of the head and body, and in appearance and colour resemble the smaller fronds of the
  surrounding sea-weed. So far the coloration is simply aggressive, and helps to conceal the Fish
  from its prey, but in addition the animal is provided with a special device for luring its prey
  within the reach of its capacious and Frog-like mouth. The first three spines <span
  class="pagenum" id="page174"><span class="smaller">{174}</span></span>of the dorsal fin are
  detached from one another and greatly elongated, and moreover extend along the middle of the
  dorsal surface of the head. The first, which is the longest, terminates in lobes or lappets of
  skin, and can be freely moved in every direction by the muscles inserted into its base. By the
  agitation of this lure or bait smaller Fishes, probably mistaking the disturbance for the presence
  of a wriggling worm, are tempted to their fate, and soon find themselves engulfed in the enormous
  mouth of the artful angler.<a id="NtA_144" href="#Nt_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a> In some allied
  forms (e.g. <i>Ceratias bispinosus</i> and <i>Oneirodes eschrichtii</i>)<a id="NtA_145"
  href="#Nt_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a> which live in the abyssal darkness of the deep sea, use is
  made of the attraction which light has to aquatic animals, and the fishing-rod spine terminates in
  a phosphorescent organ, which is probably used for enticing smaller Fishes within the reach of the
  jaws of these singularly modified Angler-Fishes.<a id="NtA_146"
  href="#Nt_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is by no means improbable that examples of "warning" coloration occur amongst Fishes. The
  brilliant colours of some of the Trigger-Fishes (<i>Balistes</i>, <i>Monacanthus</i>),
  Coffer-Fishes (<i>Ostracion</i>), and Globe-Fishes (<i>Tetrodon</i>) are perhaps of this nature.
  They are often associated with the presence of strong spines, defensive and often erectile, either
  in connexion with the dorsal fin or on the general surface of the body, and may therefore serve
  the purpose of a danger signal to such predatory foes of these Fishes as might otherwise be
  tempted to attack them&mdash;to the mutual advantage of the Fishes themselves and their would-be
  enemies. The British Weever-Fish (<i>Trachinus</i>) may perhaps offer another example of warning
  coloration.<a id="NtA_147" href="#Nt_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> The Fish is armed with poisonous
  spines on its opercula, and, in addition, has a conspicuous black dorsal fin. When the body of the
  Fish is buried in the sand, only its projecting dorsal fin remains to indicate its whereabouts to
  predatory Gurnards, which might otherwise mistake the Weever for harmless Fishes of similar size
  and habits. The existence of "recognition" colours or markings peculiar to the species, to enable
  individuals of the same species to recognise one another and to keep together in shoals, has not
  yet been proved. It is probable that the relatively <span class="pagenum" id="page175"><span
  class="smaller">{175}</span></span>limited range of vision, even in the clearest water, would
  render coloration unsuitable for this purpose. Recognition sounds are likely to be far more
  effective, and there is evidence of their production by a special vocal mechanism in many
  Fishes.<a id="NtA_148" href="#Nt_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The examples given above show how natural selection may lead to the evolution of distinctive
  forms of coloration which are advantageous to the Fish either for concealment, aggression, or
  protection, and in conclusion it may be pointed out that by the same cause colour may be
  eliminated or its development checked if in any way harmful to the animal; and further, that if a
  particular coloration becomes useless to the Fish by reason of a change in its habits or
  environment, natural selection ceasing to act where its intervention is no longer necessary to
  maintain the coloration, the latter will sooner or later tend to disappear.</p>

  <p>The absence of pigment is sometimes protective. The surface-swimming larvae of many Teleosts
  have no chromatophores, and therefore no obvious pigmentary colours. Their bodies are so
  translucent that they can be seen through, and hence are visible only with difficulty. The
  transparency of the body may even be increased by the absence of the red haemoglobin of the blood,
  as is the case with the pelagic <i>Leptocephalus</i>-larvae of the Eel.<a id="NtA_149"
  href="#Nt_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a> The iridocytes of the reflecting tissue may also disappear
  under the influence of changed surroundings. The larvae of various species of <i>Onus</i>
  (Gadidae) are silvery in hue during their pelagic career, owing to the presence of iridocytes in
  the skin, but on becoming mature they change to a dull dark colour, and live under stones or in
  holes and crevices in the rocks. During the change of habit the reflecting tissue (argenteum) is
  lost, and the needful chromatophores are acquired.<a id="NtA_150"
  href="#Nt_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="sp3">Instances of the loss of pigmentary colours, owing to the cessation of the
  controlling influence of natural selection, are to be found in the absence of chromatophores on
  the white under surface of the Flat-Fishes, where such colours are useless but not necessarily
  harmful, and in the colourless, cave-inhabiting Fishes, of which the Blind-Fish
  (<i>Amblyopsis</i>) of North America may be taken as an example.</p>

  <p>The two British species of "Weever" (<i>Trachinus draco</i> and <i>T. vipera</i>) are both
  provided with poison-organs in connexion with a spine on the operculum and with the five or six
  spiny rays of the anterior dorsal fin.<a id="NtA_151" href="#Nt_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a> The
  first of these spines is a structure projecting backwards from the hinder margin of the opercular
  bone of the gill-cover, and is traversed along both its upper and lower margins, from base to
  point, by a deep groove. Except at its protruding naked point the spine is ensheathed in an
  extension of the external skin. Along each of the grooves there extends a solid pear-shaped mass
  of gland-cells, the broad base of which coincides with the base of the spine, while the gradually
  tapering, narrower portion is continued as far as the sharp point. The glands enclose no cavity,
  and there is no duct, so that whatever poisonous fluid their cells secrete is probably set free by
  the rupture of the cells and discharged into the grooves, along which it passes to the point of
  the spine, somewhat after the fashion of a hypodermic syringe. The origin of the gland-cells from
  an in-pushing of the epidermis is indicated by the continuity of the two structures near the point
  of the spine. Both in structure and in their relation to poison-glands each of the spines of the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page177"><span class="smaller">{177}</span></span>dorsal fin is almost
  precisely similar to the opercular spine. There is no evidence as to how the poison is ejected
  into a wound, and it can only be conjectured that it may be caused by the pressure exerted on the
  gland when the spine is forcibly thrust for some distance into the flesh. Certain it is that these
  structures are capable of inflicting painful and troublesome wounds when the Fish is incautiously
  handled and the skin accidentally punctured, and no doubt they can be used with great effect as
  offensive organs.</p>

  <p>A similar poison apparatus exists in certain species of Batrachidae, such as <i>Thalassophryne
  reticulata</i>,<a id="NtA_152" href="#Nt_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> which is by no means uncommon
  at Panama. This apparatus is formed by a spinous outgrowth from the opercular bone and by the
  first two dorsal spines. Instead, however, of having two grooves, the opercular spine resembles
  the fang of a venomous snake, and is perforated by a complete canal which is only open at the base
  and point of the spine. A poison-sac at the base of the spine discharges its contents into the
  canal. The nature of the glands which secrete the poison has yet to be discovered, but it is
  probable either that there are glands in connexion with the poison-sac, or that the latter is
  lined by a glandular epithelium. The structure of the dorsal spines is similar. In some species of
  the Scorpaenoid genus <i>Synancia</i><a id="NtA_153" href="#Nt_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> (e.g.
  <i>S. verrucosa</i>, from the Indian Ocean), the terminal portions of the dorsal spines are deeply
  grooved on each side, and at the origin of each groove there is a pear-shaped bag containing a
  milky poison. The bag is prolonged into a duct which, after traversing the groove, opens at the
  extremity of the spine.</p>

  <p>Many Siluridae are armed with powerful and often serrated dorsal and pectoral spines which are
  certainly capable of inflicting dangerous wounds, and not a few of them possess a sac-like organ
  with an external opening in the axilla of the pectoral fin. It is possible that the sac secretes a
  poison for anointing the spine, but at present there is no evidence that such is the case, or that
  the sac produces any poisonous secretion at all.<a id="NtA_154"
  href="#Nt_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="sp3">Among the Elasmobranchs the Eagle-Rays (<i>A&euml;tobatis</i>),<a id="NtA_155"
  href="#Nt_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> and the Sting-Rays (<i>Trygon</i>), have barbed or serrated
  spines on the tail, which inflict wounds far more severe than those caused by <span
  class="pagenum" id="page178"><span class="smaller">{178}</span></span>mere mechanical laceration;
  but, except the mucus secreted by the gland cells of the skin, which may possess venomous
  properties, no special poison-forming glands in connexion with the spines are at present
  known.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Phosphorescent Organs.</b><a id="NtA_156" href="#Nt_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In common with many other animals of similar habitat, phosphorescent organs (photophores) are
  highly characteristic structures in many deep-sea Teleosts belonging to widely different families
  (e.g. <i>Stomiatidae</i>, <i>Scopelidae</i>, <i>Halosauridae</i>, and <i>Anomalopidae</i>). These
  organs probably had their origin in local aggregations of the gland cells of the epidermis, which
  had acquired the power of secreting a luminous slime. Luminous organs vary greatly in number and
  in their mode of distribution in the skin. Usually they are found on the sides and ventral surface
  of the body and head, very rarely on the dorsal surface, and they often present the appearance of
  brightly glistening jewels set in the skin. A very frequent method of arrangement is in one or two
  longitudinal lines along the lateral and ventral surfaces, sometimes extending continuously from
  the head to the end of the tail (Fig. 371, A, and Fig. 379), but occasionally interrupted and
  limited to portions of the body and tail; and in a few a distinctly metameric disposition is
  obvious. On the other hand, the very numerous and simple organs of <i>Opostomias</i> are disposed
  in many transverse bands along the sides of the Fish. In addition to these organs, which are
  usually numerous, and whose arrangement is linear, specially large and often structurally complex
  luminous organs are present on different parts of the head and body. In <i>Opostomias
  micripnus</i> there is a phosphorescent organ on a median barbel depending from the chin.
  <i>Sternoptyx diaphana</i> has one on the lower jaw. The presence of one or two organs beneath the
  eyes (Fig. 96) is characteristic of several species (e.g. <i>Opostomias micripnus</i>,
  <i>Astronesthes niger</i>, <i>Pachystomias microdon</i>, <i>Scopelus benoitii</i>, <i>Malacosteus
  indicus</i>). <i>Opostomias micripnus</i> has a luminous organ on the isolated and elongated first
  fin ray of the pectoral fin, while in certain deep-sea Angler-Fishes (e.g. <i>Ceratias</i>) there
  is one on the anterior cephalic fin-ray of the dorsal fin. The Scopelid <i>Ipnops <span
  class="pagenum" id="page179"><span class="smaller">{179}</span></span>murrayi</i><a id="NtA_157"
  href="#Nt_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a> (Fig. 371, C) has a singular organ, probably luminous, beneath
  the transparent superficial bones of each side of the roof of the skull. Another member of the
  same family (<i>Scopelus benoitii</i>) is interesting in having a phosphorescent organ in the
  middle of the back, which is directed backwards. An American genus of Batrachidae
  (<i>Porichthys</i>) has about 350 photophores in relation with the lateral sense-organs of each
  side of the head and body.<a id="NtA_158" href="#Nt_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> The existence of
  luminous organs has also been noticed in the Haddock (<i>Gadidae</i>).<a id="NtA_159"
  href="#Nt_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a> A primitive form of photophore, distributed in considerable
  numbers on the head and trunk, either in lines or diffused over the surface, exists in eleven

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Diversity of structure is equally marked. The essential part of each luminous organ is always a
  collection of gland cells, usually disposed so as to form the lining of a series of radially
  arranged gland-tubules in the deeper part of the organ, which also contains ganglion cells, and is
  supplied with nerves from contiguous spinal or cranial nerves. The simplest form of phosphorescent
  organ consists of little more than these essential elements. In the more complex organs an
  investing pigment-sheath, reflecting and lens-like structures, and an iris diaphragm, either
  singly or in combination, may be added. Fig. 97 represents one of the simplest types of
  phosphorescent organ, which, in groups of <span class="pagenum" id="page180"><span
  class="smaller">{180}</span></span>50 to 100, are arranged in transverse bands on the sides of
  <i>Opostomias micripnus</i>, and appear as small white spots on the otherwise black skin of this
  Fish.</p>

  <p>Each organ has the shape of a biconvex lens, sunk to about half its thickness in the skin. The
  inner half is formed of radially-arranged gland tubes filled with small granular cells, and
  converging towards the centre of the organ. Into the connective-tissue walls of the tubes extend
  blood-vessels and nerves. External to the gland tubes there is a layer of long slender cells
  arranged perpendicularly to the surface, and more externally still a layer of ganglion cells.
  There is evidence that these organs multiply by division. Such simple phosphorescent organs as
  these differ little from the groups of epidermic gland cells, which probably formed the
  evolutionary starting-point in the development of these singular structures.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A much more complex type of luminous organ is to be found in the suborbital organs of
  <i>Pachystomias microdon</i>, of which there are two on each side, appearing as conspicuous white
  masses, one in front of the other, and situated just below the eye. The more anterior of the two
  organs is somewhat pouch-shaped in section, its walls consisting of several concentric layers
  (Fig. 98). Externally there is a layer of black pigment, within which is a stratum of irregular
  gland tubes. More internally still there is a thick layer of light-reflecting spicules, probably
  derived from an inverted and modified dermal scale. The axial part of the organ is occupied by a
  number of radial-disposed structures, probably similar to the gland tubes of the simple organs of
  <i>Opostomias</i>, and continuous with a lens-like structure which, as it were, closes the
  expanded mouth of the pouch. The superficial skin which forms the margin of the aperture partially
  projects over the outer surface <span class="pagenum" id="page181"><span
  class="smaller">{181}</span></span>of the lens-like body, somewhat after the fashion of an
  iris-diaphragm. The organ is supplied by a branch of the fifth cranial nerve. Between such simple
  and complex organs as those above described there are various other types which are more or less
  intermediate in character.</p>

  <p>A particular type of phosphorescent organ is not necessarily restricted to the same species;
  both the simplest and one or more of the more complex types may be represented in the same Fish.
  Thus, <i>Opostomias micripnus</i>, which frequents depths of over 2000 fathoms, has not only the
  simple organs described above, but also others differing from the former in having an external
  pigmentary sheath, which are scattered all over the body at intervals of 1 to 3 mm. There are also
  larger and still more complex organs which are disposed in two parallel rows along each side of
  the body; and finally, the same species has special luminous organs on a median chin-barbel, and
  also on an elongated fin-ray pertaining to the pectoral fin.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The light emitted by phosphorescent organs is probably of use to deep-sea Fishes in
  enabling them to seek and detect their prey in the sunless depths which they frequent. The
  position of the organs on the sides and ventral surface of the body, and the frequent presence of
  special luminous organs in the vicinity of the mouth, render them admirably adapted to light up
  the water in front of and beneath the Fish, while the existence of optical accessories for
  intensifying the luminous beams, and for regulating their distribution, combined with an abundant
  nervous supply, suggests that the emission of light is under the control of the Fish, and may be
  varied as the occasion requires. That these organs may also be defensive, in some instances at all
  events, seems not improbable. A flash-light from the dorsal luminous organ or "stern-chaser" of
  <i>Scopelus benoitii</i> would probably dazzle and frighten an enemy in hot pursuit of the
  <i>Scopelus</i>. The use of phosphorescent organs as baits or lures for enticing prey has already
  been alluded to. There is some evidence that the colour of the emitted light differs in different
  Fishes; and as there is considerable variety in the precise disposition of the organs, it seems
  probable that in deep-sea Fishes recognition lights may take the place of the recognition colours
  and sounds of those whose lot is cast in a sunnier habitat.</p>

  class="larger">CHAPTER VII</span></h3>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="smaller">THE SKIN AND SCALES</span></p>

  <p>The skin of the Cyclostomata and Fishes consists (1) of the epidermis, formed of several layers
  of epidermic cells, which are constantly being recruited by the division of the cells of the basal
  layer; and (2) of a stratum of connective tissue with intermingled unstriped muscle-fibres,
  blood-vessels and nerves, which constitutes the deeper layer or dermis. From the epidermis are
  formed the various unicellular or multicellular glands with which the skin is provided; and from
  one or both of the skin layers originate the different calcareous structures which constitute the
  hard exoskeleton.</p>

  <p>In the Cyclostomata the epidermis is particularly rich in goblet-shaped, mucus-secreting,
  gland-cells. The Myxinoids also possess numerous pockets of so-called "thread-cells." In each of
  these cells the protoplasm secretes a long spirally-coiled thread, and under the influence of
  appropriate stimuli the thread is shot out and unwound to a great length. The threads and the
  mucus are so abundant that one of these animals will convert a bucket of water into a thick mass
  of jelly. No scales or other hard exoskeletal structures are present in any of the
  Cyclostomata.</p>

  <p>In Fishes mucus-glands are also abundant in the epidermis, and to their activity is due the
  slimy mucus which lubricates the surface of the body. They are specially numerous in the Dipnoi
  (e.g. <i>Protopterus</i>), where, in addition, there are many simple multicellular glands which
  secrete the "cocoon" or capsule in which the Fish is enclosed during the dry season. From the
  epidermis are derived the poison-glands of some Teleosts, and also the "glandula pterygopodia" in
  relation with the claspers of the male Elasmobranchs. The glandular structures in connexion with
  <span class="pagenum" id="page183"><span class="smaller">{183}</span></span>the phosphorescent
  organs of the deep-sea Fishes will no doubt be traced to the same source.</p>

  <p>In the great majority of Fishes the skin becomes the seat of calcareous deposit, and gives rise
  to such diverse exoskeletal structures as the varied forms of spines and scales with which the
  surface of a Fish is invested.<a id="NtA_161" href="#Nt_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> These
  structures, probably the most ancient form of Vertebrate skeleton owing its existence to the
  presence of lime salts in the tissues of the body, present highly characteristic modifications in
  the different groups.</p>

  <p>Exoskeletal structures are of two kinds: (1) those which owe their formation to the secretory
  activity of cells belonging both to the epidermis and the dermis, and (2) those which are derived
  solely from the dermis. To the first belong the dermal denticles or so-called placoid scales of
  most Elasmobranchs, and to the second the scales which form the skin-skeleton of living and
  extinct Teleostomi and Dipnoi. With the exception of enamel, which is always formed by the cells
  of the epidermis, the hard exoskeletal tissues owe their existence to the secretion of certain
  cells of the dermis (scleroblasts),<a id="NtA_162" href="#Nt_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a> the
  inclusion of which in a growing calcifying tissue is the cause of whatever cellular structure the
  tissue may present. It will shortly be apparent that the dermic scleroblasts are by no means
  uniform in their products, and that in different Fishes they give rise to widely different hard
  tissues.</p>

  <p>The dermal denticles or "shagreen" of the ordinary Sharks and Dog-Fishes (Elasmobranchii)
  probably represent the most primitive form of exoskeleton. In the development of a dermal denticle
  a papilla of the dermis grows up into the overlying epidermis, pushing before it the basal layer
  of epidermic cells, which forms an investment to the papilla and constitutes the so-called "enamel
  organ" (Fig. 100). The papilla itself subsequently becomes converted into dentine, leaving,
  however, a central pulp-cavity, while the apex of the papilla is invested by a cap of enamel
  formed by the enamel organ. Ultimately the base of the papilla widens out into a more or less
  rhomboidal basal plate formed of bone. In this way there is formed a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page184"><span class="smaller">{184}</span></span>pointed, enamel-tipped spine of dentine
  which protrudes through the epidermis, and projects backwards on the surface of the body, but is
  firmly fixed in the skin by the basal plate with which it is continuous. The centre of the under
  surface of the basal plate is perforated for the entrance of the blood-vessels which pass to the
  cellular pulp in the axis of the spine. In the adult Fish the denticles form a fairly close-set
  covering to the whole body, including the head and even the surfaces of the fins, and are larger
  on the dorsal than on the ventral surface (Fig. 99). In the Rays (<i>Raia</i>) they are more
  sparsely scattered, and in different parts of the body may form spines of considerable size for
  offensive or defensive purposes. The spines vary greatly in shape in different members of the
  group, sometimes being acutely pointed, and sometimes flattened or depressed, and often they are
  furnished with smaller accessory spines developed at their bases or from the surface of the basal
  plate. An arrangement of the denticles in oblique transverse rows is observable in some genera
  (e.g. <i>Scyllium</i>). In the Saw-Fishes (e.g. <i>Pristis</i>) the denticles which fringe the
  lateral margins of the long flattened rostrum are not only enormously enlarged, but are implanted
  in sockets and form the teeth of the saw (Fig. 262). In the Holocephali the smooth skin is almost
  entirely devoid of exoskeletal structures, but dermal denticles are present on the frontal and
  anterior claspers, and in the young there may be a double row of small denticles along the
  back.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the remaining groups of Fishes, the Teleostomi and the Dipnoi, the spine of the primitive
  dermal denticle is either evanescent or entirely wanting, while the equivalent of the basal plate
  remains to form the unit of a scaly armature. Evidence of this may be found in the presence of
  transitory evanescent spines, provided with an enamel-cap, secreted by the basal epidermis, on the
  developing rhomboidal scales, as in the young <i>Lepidosteus</i><a id="NtA_163"
  href="#Nt_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> (Fig. 101); while the entrance of blood-vessels into the
  scales through perforations on their inner surfaces, as in <i>Polypterus</i> and
  <i>Lepidosteus</i>, obviously recalls the perforated base of a dermal denticle (Fig. 99). The
  epidermis now ceases to take any part in the formation of the scales, and hence enamel no longer
  enters into their structure. A more regular and definite arrangement of the scales is noticeable,
  and whether distinct, or articulating with one another, or overlapping like the slates on the roof
  of a house, they are usually disposed in a series of successive oblique transverse rows. In some
  of these Fishes the embryonic epidermic covering of the scales becomes lost, and their outer
  surfaces are naked. More frequently, as in the generality of Teleosts, and in the Dipnoi, the
  reverse is the case, and the scales are more or less completely invested both by the dermis and
  the epidermis. As regards their shape, size, and minute structure there is much variation. In some
  Teleostomi <span class="pagenum" id="page186"><span class="smaller">{186}</span></span>the
  primitive rhomboidal shape of the dermal denticle is retained; in others a rounded or cycloid
  scale supplants the earlier rhombic type. Within the limits of the same group (<i>e.g.</i>
  Crossopterygii) there are examples of the independent evolution of a cycloid from a pre-existing
  rhombic squamation; and with the introduction of the cycloid type an overlapping or imbricated
  disposition of the scales always takes the place of the marginal articulation of the rhombic
  type.</p>

  <p>As to the causes which may have determined the shape and mutual relations of scales interesting
  suggestions have been made.<a id="NtA_164" href="#Nt_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> Scales bear a
  segmental relation to the subjacent muscle-segments or myotomes, sometimes being disposed in
  oblique transverse rows coinciding with the latter, or the rows may be so far increased as to be
  multiples of the myotomes. From mechanical considerations depending on the sigmoid shape and
  interdigitating relations of the myotomes and their separating fibrous septa or myocommata, and
  the attachment of the myocommata to the dermis, the contraction of the myotomes during the lateral
  flexions of the trunk in swimming has a tendency to wrinkle the skin into definitely circumscribed
  rhombic areas, thus determining the shape, limits, and disposition of the scales which are
  developed in those areas. The rhombic was probably the primitive shape of scales, and is certainly
  characteristic of the palaeontologically older types of scaly Fishes. Generally the rhombic
  condition is associated with a peg-and-socket articulation between the upper and lower margins of
  adjacent scales. But a rhombic squamation is not without <span class="pagenum" id="page187"><span
  class="smaller">{187}</span></span>disadvantages, and would certainly impose some restriction on
  the lateral flexures of the body in swimming, and hence in the different groups of Fishes it may
  happen that, in the more specialised forms, an imbricated cycloid squamation supersedes a rhombic
  condition, and with the change the Fish acquires greater lateral mobility. Even in the same Fish
  the gradual substitution of the cycloid for the rhombic type may be observed. In the Australian
  <i>Aetheolepis</i>,<a id="NtA_165" href="#Nt_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> a fossil genus related to
  the European Liassic <i>Dapedius</i>, there is a gradual transition along the sides of the body
  between the articulated rhombic scales of the relatively immobile trunk and the cycloid
  overlapping scales of the flexible tail; and it may be mentioned that, even where a typical
  rhombic squamation exists, the peg-and-socket articulation may be wanting in the caudal region, so
  as to ensure greater freedom of movement. Mechanical considerations may also explain the
  overlapping of cycloid scales. From the mode of attachment of the myocommata to the dermis, the
  contractions of the myotomes, through the pull which they exert on the former, tend to deflect or
  depress the scale-areas, particularly at their anterior margins.</p>

  <p>In the surviving Crossopterygii, as in <i>Polypterus</i>, the scales are rhomboidal and thick,
  and they only slightly overlap. They articulate with one another by means of marginal
  peg-and-socket articulations (Fig. 106, B). A thick layer of hard, glistening, enamel-like
  substance or "ganoin" forms the outer layer of the scale; the inner layer consisting of bone in
  which dentinal tubules as well as bone-cells are present. In the numerous fossil members of the
  group the scales are either rhomboidal or cycloid.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page188"><span class="smaller">{188}</span></span></div>

  <p>The oldest representatives of the Chondrostei, the Palaeoniscidae (Fig. 283) possessed a
  complete armature of rhombic scales, but in all the surviving members of the group the scales have
  undergone considerable modification in some respects, and in others are degenerate. In the
  Sturgeon (<i>Acipenser</i>)<a id="NtA_166" href="#Nt_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a> the primitive
  rhombic squamation is retained only on the sides of the terminal part of the tail, and there they
  are in close apposition in oblique rows. The rest of the body is traversed by five
  widely-separated longitudinal rows of large bony scutes, which, like the rhombic scales, are
  furnished with ridges and projecting spines (Fig. 102). Between the rows of large scales there are
  numerous denticle-like structures arranged in oblique rows. Each of these consists of a basal
  plate imbedded in the dermis, and of one or more projecting spines which perforate the epidermis.
  All the scales have the same minute structure, consisting mainly of bone; but the surface layer
  and the spines seem to be composed of a hard laminated substance from which bone-cells are absent
  (ganoin). In <i>Polyodon</i> the scutes are wanting, but vestigial denticles are retained.</p>

  contrary, the relatively thin scales are cycloid in shape, and in their imbricated arrangement, in
  their enclosure in pouches of the dermis, and in the absence of any superficial covering of
  ganoin, they are very similar to the scales of the more typical Teleosts (Fig. 295). The

  bone, which gradually passes into an inner fibrous stratum.</p>

  <p>In Teleosts the usually thin and flexible scales are primarily developed from dermic papillae,
  but subsequently they come to lie in pockets or pouches in the dermis. As a rule no spines are
  developed, and so far no trace of an enamel organ has been detected during their development. The
  scales in their dermal pouches are disposed obliquely to the surface of the body, so that the
  hinder part of one scale overlaps the anterior portion of the scale next behind it (Fig. 104).
  Only the free hinder part of each scale has an epidermic investment (Fig. 105). In minute
  structure each scale consists of an outer layer of bone, which, like the bone of the endoskeleton,
  may either be homogeneous except for a feeble lamination, or it may contain bone-cells arranged in
  successive layers, parallel to the surface of the scale. In addition, there is an inner fibrous
  stratum in which the fibrous bundles in any one plane cross those in planes above or below them.
  The scales are either "cycloid," that is, they have smooth, unbroken margins (Fig. 105), or the
  free margin of each scale is produced into a series of tooth-like spines, and the scale is said to
  be "ctenoid" (Fig. 106, A).</p>

  <p>Some Teleosts, however, have scales which are neither cycloid nor ctenoid, and in certain
  features seem to be intermediate between ordinary Teleostean scales and dermal denticles. Thus, on
  certain parts of the body of <i>Centriscus</i>,<a id="NtA_168" href="#Nt_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a>
  each scale consists <span class="pagenum" id="page190"><span class="smaller">{190}</span></span>of
  a rhombic basal plate, produced into a curved, backwardly-inclined spine, the axis of which
  contains a pulp-cavity opening on the inner surface of the basal plate (Fig. 107). Some Malthidae
  (e.g. <i>Malthe</i><a id="NtA_169" href="#Nt_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a>) have similar scales, but
  with round basal plates and solid spines (Fig. 108, B). Similar scales (Fig. 109), sometimes
  rhombic in shape, with one or more spines, which may be simple or branched, are also found in the
  Sclerodermi (e.g. <i>Balistes</i>, <i>Monacanthus</i>, <i>Triacanthus</i>).<a id="NtA_170"

  <p>Amongst some of the usually scaleless Siluroid Fishes the scales assume a very peculiar
  structure. In <i>Hypostoma</i><a id="NtA_171" href="#Nt_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a>
  (<i>Plecostomus</i>) the sides and back of the Fish are covered by large bony plates, but on the
  under surface and on the fins these are replaced by much smaller ones. Both kinds, however, carry
  numerous small movable spines implanted in sockets (Fig. 110), a fact which suggests comparison
  with a stage in the development of the scales of <i>Lepidosteus</i>, when the independently formed
  and evanescent spines have not yet fused with the basal plates.</p>

  <p>In other Teleosts, as in the Agonidae and some Triglidae, the body is completely cuirassed with
  large keeled bony plates. The singular appearance of many of the Plectognathi is largely <span
  class="pagenum" id="page191"><span class="smaller">{191}</span></span>the result of the curious
  modifications which their scales undergo. In some of the Coffer-Fishes (<i>Ostracion</i>) these
  structures assume the form of polygonal bony plates which suturally articulate with one another
  and enclose the trunk in a rigid cuirass, from which the scaleless tail protrudes behind (Fig.
  438); while in some Globe-Fishes and Porcupine-Fishes (e.g. <i>Tetrodon</i>, <i>Diodon</i>) the
  prolongation of the scales into strong erectile spines equally well serves the purpose of
  protection (Fig. 439).</p>

  <p>Most Teleostomi have the scales along the "lateral line" perforated by single or multiple
  apertures, through which the sensory canal communicates with the exterior.</p>

  <p>The concentric rings observable (Fig. 105) on the surface of many Teleostean scales are an
  index to the age of the <span class="pagenum" id="page192"><span
  class="smaller">{192}</span></span>Fish.<a id="NtA_172" href="#Nt_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a> The
  formation of these rings depends on the fact that the lines of growth on the surface of the scale
  are more widely separated from one another on that portion of the scale formed during summer, and
  relatively closer together on that part which is formed during the winter; the more rapid growth
  in the warmer season probably being due to favourable conditions as to food and temperature, and
  the retarded growth of the colder season to the reverse. Hence, by counting the alternating zones
  of close-set winter lines and less closely approximated summer lines of growth, a reliable clue
  may be gained as to the age of the Fish.</p>

  <p>In the Dipnoi,<a id="NtA_173" href="#Nt_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a> as in Teleosts, the scales
  are enclosed in dermal pockets, and exhibit a regular, imbricated disposition in oblique rows
  (Fig. 304, A). In shape they are nearly cycloid, or slightly oval, with the long axis coinciding
  with that of the body. Structurally, also, they bear some resemblance to Teleostean scales,
  although differing in details. On the outer surface of the scales there are numerous small conical
  spines. No significance, other than as an example of evolutionary convergence, can be attached to
  the resemblance between the scales of Fishes so widely separated as the Dipnoi and the
  Teleosts.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="smaller">THE SKELETON</span></p>

  <p>All Fishes possess an internal skeleton which, in order that it may be distinguished from the
  more superficial scaly exoskeleton described in Chapter VII., is termed the endoskeleton. The
  latter consists (i.) of an axial part, including the vertebral column and the skull; and (ii.) of
  an appendicular portion, consisting of the skeleton of the limbs and their supporting pectoral and
  pelvic girdles.</p>

  <p><b>The Vertebral Column.</b><a id="NtA_174" href="#Nt_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a>&mdash;The
  individual segments or vertebrae which, arranged in a linear series, collectively form the
  vertebral column, are highly complex structures, each being formed by a number of vertebral
  elements, the sum total of which constitutes a vertebra. Perhaps the best conception of the nature
  of vertebral elements is to be gleaned from the study of such primitive Fishes as the
  Elasmobranchs, in which not only are all the vertebral components present, but they are less
  modified by suppression and fusion than in most other Fishes, and on this account they afford a
  convenient introduction to the study of the puzzling eccentricities of vertebral structure in
  other groups. Selecting any common Dog-Fish, such as <i>Scyllium canicula</i>, and starting with
  an early embryonic stage, it may be stated that the first indication of a vertebral column is the
  formation of the notochord, which, invested by its chordal sheath, extends from the tip of the
  tail to a point on the under surface of the brain just behind the hypophysis or pituitary
  body.</p>

      exits of the dorsal and ventral roots of spinal nerves. (After Ridewood.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Subsequently, a number of cartilaginous pieces are developed in connexion with the dorsal and
  ventral surfaces of the notochord, which, as they form portions of a system of dorsal and ventral
  arches, are termed "arcualia" (Fig. 111). On the dorsal side there are: (i.) a series of paired
  <i>basi-dorsal</i> cartilages (neurapophyses or neural arches), the two elements of each pair
  contributing to form the side walls of the neural canal in which the spinal cord is lodged (Fig.
  112, A); (ii.) a series of <i>inter-dorsal</i> cartilages (intercalary neural arches), regularly
  alternating with the preceding, and completing the walls of the neural canal by filling up the
  intervals between the basi-dorsals; and (iii.) a series of <i>supra-dorsal</i> elements, typically
  also in pairs, but in the Dog-Fish fused to form single median cartilages. Of the latter there are
  two sets&mdash;one the <i>supra-basi-dorsals</i>, or neural spines, are situated over the
  basi-dorsals; and the other, <i>supra-inter-dorsals</i>, alternating with the former, lie over the
  inter-dorsals, the two series forming the keystones of the dorsal arches, and thus completing the
  roof of the neural canal. On the ventral side of the notochord this arrangement is substantially
  repeated by a series of ventral arcualia, which, however, are somewhat differently arranged in the
  trunk and tail. Thus, in the trunk there are: (i.) a series of <i>basi-ventral</i> or haemal
  cartilages, corresponding with the basi-dorsals above, which grow out laterally into short
  processes, the <i>parapophyses</i> or transverse processes, and terminate in (ii.) short, slender
  cartilages&mdash;the costal elements or <i>ribs</i>&mdash;which may perhaps be regarded as the
  ventral equivalents of supra-basi-dorsals. The ribs project outwards into the dorsal wall of the
  coelom and end in the myocommata separating the myotomes of the body-wall. In the tail the
  basi-ventrals lose their ribs and, growing downwards into ventral prolongations, they unite in
  pairs beneath the caudal artery and vein, and so form a series of inverted arches <span
  class="pagenum" id="page195"><span class="smaller">{195}</span></span>(<i>haemal arches</i>)
  enclosing a haemal canal (Fig. 112, B). The apex of each arch is prolonged into a median process
  or <i>haemal spine</i>. Although not recognisable in the Dog-Fish, paired <i>inter-ventral</i>
  cartilages, corresponding with the inter-dorsals above, are present in some Elasmobranchs and
  alternate with the basi-ventrals. In the caudal region of others (<i>e.g.</i> Skates and Rays)
  ventral counterparts of the supra-interdorsals are present, and are termed <i>infra-ventral</i>
  cartilages. Much in the same way that their dorsal equivalents enclose a neural canal, so the
  ventral arcualia partially surround the viscera-containing coelom in the trunk; and in the tail,
  but more completely, the vestigial coelom of that region or the haemal canal.</p>

  <p>The different vertebral components are by no means of equal morphological value. The
  basi-dorsals and basi-ventrals, and the inter-dorsals and inter-ventrals, are the primary elements
  and the most important. The supra-dorsals are merely cartilages segmented off from the
  basi-dorsals and inter-dorsals, while the ribs and the infra-ventrals are similarly derived from
  the basi-ventrals and inter-ventrals respectively. As to the vertebral elements which collectively
  form a vertebra in the Dog-Fish, it would seem from evidence afforded by the neuromeres,<a
  id="NtA_175" href="#Nt_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a> and more especially by the facts of development,
  that each complete skeletal segment or vertebra consists of a pair of basi-dorsals with the
  preceding pair of inter-dorsals, and of a pair of basi-ventrals with the next succeeding pair of
  inter-ventrals. It must be emphasised, however, that, considered as a joint or segment in a
  flexible back-bone, a vertebra is a physiological unit, the morphological value of which may
  differ widely in different Fishes. Hence, in other Fishes, the grouping of vertebral components to
  <span class="pagenum" id="page196"><span class="smaller">{196}</span></span>form individual
  vertebrae may be quite different to that which takes place in the Dog-Fish, and may even be
  accompanied by their more or less complete fusion.</p>

  <p>In the more primitive types of vertebral column, such as are characteristic of many fossil and
  not a few existing Fishes, arcualia alone are present, and remain associated with a persistent
  notochord which has grown with the growth of the animal. In the more specialised Fishes, on the
  contrary, the need of an axial support for the body, which, while retaining the necessary
  flexibility, must possess greater strength, has resulted in the development of a series of solid
  cartilaginous, calcified or bony, discoidal joints or segments, the <i>centra</i>, which surround
  and more or less completely replace the notochord, and, while supporting, form also a bond of
  connexion between the dorsal and ventral arches. Notwithstanding their superficial resemblance, an
  important developmental distinction is to be noted in the mode of formation of centra in different
  Fishes, which enables one kind to be distinguished as "<i>chorda-centra</i>," and another as
  "<i>arch-centra</i>."<a id="NtA_176" href="#Nt_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a> Chorda-centra are centra
  formed by the conversion of the chordal sheath into a series of ring-like cartilaginous segments,
  which subsequently, by a process of inward thickening, become biconcave, disc-like structures, and
  more or less completely replace the notochord, except in the spaces between them. Arch-centra, on
  the other hand, owe their formation to the growth of the bases of the primary arcualia round the
  notochord, external to the chordal sheath, and their subsequent fusion to form annular segments,
  which, later, become biconcave centra. Of Fishes which possess vertebral centra the Elasmobranchs
  alone have chorda-centra; the Holostei and the Teleostei, and very probably the Crossopterygii
  also, having arch-centra. The Dipnoi and the Holocephali, and the Chondrostean Teleostomi are
  acentrous&mdash;that is, they are devoid of vertebral centra and possess a persistent notochord.
  Neither in their embryonic development nor in their evolution in time are the different vertebral
  components synchronous in their appearance. Developmentally, the arcualia are the first to be
  formed, and of these those on the dorsal aspect of the notochord appear earlier than their
  representatives on the ventral side, while the centra are the last of all; and in a general way
  the palaeontological sequence agrees with the embryological.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page197"><span class="smaller">{197}</span></span></div>

  <p>The independent evolution of a more specialised vertebral column from a more primitive one may
  often be traced within the limits of the same group of Fishes when the more ancient genera are
  compared with the more recent. In the Elasmobranchs and the Crossopterygii, for example, the
  oldest known types were acentrous, while the more recent have acquired calcified or bony centra,
  and altogether they have reached a more advanced stage of vertebral evolution. Some Fishes, like
  the Chondrostei and the Dipnoi, seem, however, to exhibit comparatively little advance in
  vertebral structure, since both the Palaeozoic and the living representatives of these groups
  agree in being acentrous.</p>

  <p>Some of the more notable features in the structure of the vertebral column in the Cyclostomata
  and Fishes will now be briefly considered.</p>

  <p>In the Cyclostomata the acentrous vertebral column is more primitive than in any other
  Craniates, and in the Lamprey it consists of a persistent notochord, supporting a series of
  isolated cartilages on each side of the spinal cord.<a id="NtA_177"
  href="#Nt_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> As two pairs of these cartilages are included in each
  neuromere it is possible that they represent alternating basi-dorsals and inter-dorsals. There are
  no ventral arcualia in the trunk and no ribs. In the Hag-Fish (<i>Myxine</i>) the dorsal
  cartilages are restricted to the tail.</p>

  <p>The description of the vertebral column of the Dog-Fish may be taken as fairly applicable to
  Elasmobranchs in general, and hence only certain notable features in some other members of the
  group need be referred to here. The most primitive Elasmobranchs, the Palaeozoic genera
  <i>Cladoselache</i> and <i>Pleuracanthus</i> were acentrous, although calcified rings have been
  observed in a Permian species of the latter genus and scattered calcifications in others. Some of
  the earlier Mesozoic genera (e.g. <i>Hybodus</i>) were also devoid of centra, at least in the
  trunk-region. The first indication of complete centra occurs in the Lower Lias Cestraciont,
  <i>Palaeospinax</i>.<a id="NtA_178" href="#Nt_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a> All the later extinct, as
  well as all existing forms, have more or less well-developed centra, hardened by the deposit of
  lime salts in their primitively cartilaginous substance, but never in the form of true bone.</p>

  <p>The mode in which the lime is deposited is marked by certain peculiarities which are
  characteristic of particular families<a id="NtA_179" href="#Nt_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a> (Fig.
  113). In some genera, as in the extinct <i>Palaeospinax</i> and the living <i>Acanthias</i> and
  <i>Scymnus</i>, the calcified portion of each centrum takes the form of a cylinder constricted
  across the middle, like two cones joined apex to apex (cyclospondylic). This condition is probably
  the most primitive, but it may be modified in other genera by the further addition of calcic salts
  in two different ways. Thus, the deposit may take place by the simple addition of concentric
  layers to the original constricted cylinder (tectospondylic), as in the Skates and Rays; or it may
  take the form of a series of longitudinal plates radiating outwards from the cylinder, and giving
  rise to a star-like pattern in cross-section (asterospondylic), as in <i>Scyllium</i> and
  <i>Lamna</i>. In most living Elasmobranchs (e.g. <i>Scyllium</i>), but not in such genera as
  <i>Notidanus</i>, <i>Heterodontus</i>, and <i>Squatina</i>, the bases of the dorsal and ventral
  arches grow round the centra and meet, or even fuse, so that the latter become surrounded by rings
  of cartilage which, after a fashion, suggest incipient arch-centra (Fig. 112, A). The caudal
  portion of the vertebral column is often described as "diplospondylic," that is, there are two
  centra, two pairs of basi-dorsals, two pairs of inter-dorsals, and two pairs of basi-ventrals,
  <span class="pagenum" id="page199"><span class="smaller">{199}</span></span>or in other words, two
  vertebrae to each neuromere<a id="NtA_180" href="#Nt_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a> (Fig. 111, B).</p>

  <p>The Holocephali have a vertebral column essentially similar to that of other Elasmobranchs, but
  of a more primitive type (Fig. 114). The notochord is persistent and there are no centra; but
  ring-like calcifications, four or five to each neuromere, occur in the chordal sheath in
  <i>Chimaera</i>, although not in <i>Callorhynchus</i>. Ribs are absent. In the whip-like terminal
  portion of the tail the arcualia and the notochord become replaced by a slender continuous
  filament of cartilage.</p>

  <p>In the more obvious features of vertebral structure the Dipnoi<a id="NtA_181"
  href="#Nt_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a> have much in common with the Elasmobranchs, especially with
  certain of the acentrous Palaeozoic representatives of that group. The notochord is persistent,
  centra are wanting, and the different vertebral components continue to retain their primitive
  distinctness. On the other hand, the basi-dorsals are much better developed than the
  inter-dorsals, which are either vestigial or absent. The basi-dorsals unite in pairs over the
  spinal cord to form complete neural arches, and each arch supports dorsally the legs of a <span
  class="sans fwb">&Lambda;</span>-shaped, gable-like element or neural spine, which probably
  represents a pair of fused supra-basidorsals. Ventrally, there are basi-ventral cartilages, fused
  in pairs beneath the notochord, and supporting well-developed, bone-ensheathed ribs. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page200"><span class="smaller">{200}</span></span>Inter-ventrals appear to be
  absent. Each neuromere corresponds with a pair of basi-ventrals, of basi-dorsals and of
  inter-dorsals. The haemal arches and spines are formed partly by the basi-ventrals, but mainly by
  the ventral union of the successive pairs of ribs. As in the Holocephali, the terminal arcualia of
  the tail become fused into a straight axial cartilaginous filament, transversely divided into
  segments, which replaces the notochord. Each segment supports a variable number of dorsal and
  ventral gable-pieces, or neural and haemal spines. Certain of the vertebral components, such as
  the ribs, and the neural and haemal spines, are ensheathed by membrane bone.</p>

  <p>With certain modifications in details the preceding description will also apply to the

  <p>In the existing Crossopterygii, Holostei, and Teleostei, popularly known as the "bony Fishes,"
  the vertebral column assumes a more familiar character, and at the same time we meet with
  interesting illustrations of the different methods by which the separate component vertebral
  elements of the more primitive types of "backbone" are concentrated together in groups, and fused
  to form that complex physiological product, the complete bony vertebra.<a id="NtA_183"
  href="#Nt_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a> In most of these Fishes each vertebra is formed by the
  aggregation and fusion of a pair of basi-dorsals and a pair of basi-ventrals, and includes, in
  addition, a pair of inter-dorsals, which may either be the pair in front of the basi-dorsals or
  the pair behind, and also a pair of inter-ventrals, which, similarly, may be the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page202"><span class="smaller">{202}</span></span>pair in front or behind the
  basi-ventrals (Fig. 116). The product of this fusion is a series of bony vertebrae, each
  consisting of a biconcave arch-centrum, which includes the fused basal portions of a pair of
  basi-dorsals and a pair of basi-ventrals. The distal portions of the basi-dorsals form the neural
  arch, while the rib-bearing parapophyses are lateral outgrowths from the basi-ventrals which
  otherwise have become merged in the centrum. Finally, the centrum is completed by its fusion with
  a pair of inter-dorsals and a pair of inter-ventrals. Supra-dorsal elements may also be included
  as minor contributory factors. The supra-basi-dorsals co-ossify with their basi-dorsals and then
  unite to form the ordinary unpaired neural spine of most bony Fishes, or, as in <i>Amia</i>, they
  remain distinct from each other, and are obvious as a double spine. In <i>Lepidosteus</i> these
  elements co-ossify with the neural arches and form the post-zygapophyses. Supra-inter-dorsals have
  been identified in the embryo as distinct elements, but their eventual fate is not always known.
  In <i>Lepidosteus</i> they persist as distinct cartilages in the adult (Fig. 118, A).
  Well-developed bony ribs are usually present. The haemal arches of the tail are formed by the
  downgrowth of the parapophyses and their ribs, or by the latter alone, and by their ventral union
  to form haemal spines; consequently, each arch always includes a pair of costal elements. With
  such general features in common there are certain notable variations in some of these Fishes, to
  which brief reference may be made.</p>

  <p>Little is at present known of the development of the vertebral column in either of the only two
  existing genera of Crossopterygii, <i>Polypterus</i><a id="NtA_184"
  href="#Nt_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a> and <i>Calamichthys</i>, and hence the precise mode of
  grouping of their vertebral components to form vertebrae is unknown. The condition of the
  vertebral column in the fossil forms varies greatly in different families, but in none is it so
  specialised as in the surviving members of the group. In the Devonian Holoptychidae, and even in
  genera so comparatively recent as the Upper Cretaceous Coelacanth <i>Macropoma</i>, the
  persistence of the notochord and the absence of centra indicate a very primitive grade of
  vertebral evolution. The Devonian and Carboniferous Rhizodontidae (e.g. <i>Eusthenopteron</i> and
  <i>Rhizodus</i>), on the contrary, seem to have had well-ossified ring-like vertebrae.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page203"><span class="smaller">{203}</span></span></div>

  <p>In the caudal region of <i>Amia</i> the basi-dorsals and basi-ventrals, and the inter-dorsals
  and inter-ventrals, form separate arch-centra which remain distinct; hence each vertebra is
  double, and there is a regular alternation of arch-bearing "pre-centra" and arch-less
  "post-centra" (Fig. 117, D). In the trunk-region the pre- and post-centra have fused, and in this
  region the vertebrae are single.</p>

  </div>

  <p>A very primitive type of vertebral column occurs in some of the Jurassic allies of <i>Amia</i>,
  in which certain of the vertebral components, confluent in the adult <i>Amia</i>, retain some
  measure of their primitive distinctness.<a id="NtA_185" href="#Nt_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a> Thus,
  in the precaudal region of <i>Eurycormus</i> (Fig. 117, B) there is a series of alternating dorsal
  and ventral half-rings of bone, which between them completely invest the persistent notochord.
  Each ventral half-ring or "hypocentrum" represents a pair of fused and ossified basi-ventrals, and
  possibly also a pair of included inter-ventrals, and supports dorsally a pair of basi-dorsals,
  forming a neural arch, and laterally a pair of ribs. The dorsal semi-rings, or "pleuro-centra,"
  similarly represent fused and ossified pairs of inter-dorsals. In the tail, modifications
  approximating to what is seen in the caudal region of <i>Amia</i> are to be noticed (C). By the
  upgrowth of the ventral arch-bearing semi-rings, and their conversion into complete rings
  encircling the notochord, incipient pre-centra are formed, and by a similar modification of the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page204"><span class="smaller">{204}</span></span>down-growing,
  archless, dorsal half-rings, structures comparable to post-centra are produced. In brief,
  <i>Eurycormus</i>, as well as such other extinct Amioid genera as <i>Caturus</i> (Fig. 117, A),
  <i>Callopterus</i>, and <i>Euthynotus</i>, retain in the adult a stage of vertebral evolution
  which is closely paralleled by transitory stages in the embryonic and young forms of
  <i>Amia</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Lepidosteus</i><a id="NtA_186" href="#Nt_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> is unique amongst
  existing Fishes in having opisthocoelous vertebrae; that is, the centra are convex in front and
  concave behind, and therefore articulate with one another by ball-and-socket joints (Fig. 118).
  This condition is due to the development of a series of intervertebral rings of cartilage round
  the notochord. The subsequent inward growth of each of these rings leads to the constriction, and
  ultimately to the complete obliteration, of the notochord, much in the same way as by the growth
  of ordinary centra. Later, this solid mass of cartilage becomes transversely divided by a cleft
  which is convex anteriorly and concave behind (Fig. 116, C), and of the two portions one fuses and
  co-ossifies with the centrum of the vertebra in front, and the other with the one pertaining to
  the vertebra behind. Reference to Fig. 116 will show that the grouping of the vertebral elements
  to form the individual vertebrae is not the same as in <i>Amia</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page205"><span class="smaller">{205}</span></span></div>

  <p>In the dominant group of existing Fishes, the Teleostei, the centra are almost invariably
  biconcave, although in the Eels they may be flat or even slightly convex in front. Ribs are absent
  in the Syngnathidae and in the Plectognathi. In addition to the usual articulation between the
  centra, the vertebrae often articulate with one another by means of paired processes arising from
  the anterior margin of each neural arch, or from the centrum at the base of the arch
  (pre-zygapophyses), and meeting similar processes which project either from the hinder margin of
  the arch of the vertebra in front, or from the adjacent portion of its centrum
  (post-zygapophyses). The haemal arches may have similar processes (Fig. 119). One, two, or in some
  Teleosts, three pairs of slender intermuscular bones radiate outwards from the centra into the
  myocommata (epicentrals), or from the neural arch (epineurals), or from the ribs
  (epipleurals).</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>The Ribs.</b>&mdash;It is doubtful if the structures termed "ribs" are
  homologous in the different groups of Fishes. There appear to be two kinds, distinguishable as
  dorsal and ventral ribs (Fig. 156). Dorsal ribs are situated in the fibrous tissue separating the
  epiaxial from the hypaxial muscles of the body wall, and they take no part in forming the haemal
  arches of the caudal region. Ventral ribs, on the other hand, always lie internal to the hypaxial
  muscles, and directly external to the peritoneal lining of the coelom, and they usually contribute
  to the formation of <span class="pagenum" id="page206"><span
  class="smaller">{206}</span></span>the haemal arches. To the former belong the ribs of the
  Elasmobranchs, and to the latter the ribs of the Teleostomi and Dipnoi. <i>Polypterus</i> alone
  has both kinds of ribs.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>The Skull.</b></p>

  <p>The skull is a highly complex structure, the various components of which are as different
  physiologically as they are morphologically. It consists (i.) of the <i>cranium</i>, for the
  enclosure and protection of the brain; (ii.) of <i>sense capsules</i>, which fulfil a like
  function for the auditory, visual, and olfactory organs; (iii.) of certain <i>vertebrae</i> or
  vertebral elements fused with the hinder part of the cranium; (iv.) of a series of <i>visceral
  arches</i>; and (v.) of a series of paired or median cartilages developed in relation with the
  mouth and nostrils, which may be collectively spoken of as "<i>labial</i>" cartilages.</p>

  <p>The cranium is formed in the embryo from two pairs of cartilaginous rods or plates, developed
  in the mesoblast of the head. Of these the posterior pair, or <i>parachordals</i>, underlie the
  hinder part of the brain, and are situated one on each side of the cranial portion of the
  notochord. The anterior pair or <i>trabeculae</i> are pre-notochordal, and lie beneath the
  anterior portion of the brain.<a id="NtA_187" href="#Nt_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> Between their
  hinder extremities, and in front of the anterior termination of the notochord, is the pituitary
  body. As development proceeds the parachordals blend with each other and with the trabeculae,
  while the latter fuse in front to form a median plate&mdash;the mesethmoid cartilage. The hinder
  portions of the two trabeculae remain distinct for some time, and enclose between them the
  pituitary fontanelle, but later they fuse beneath the pituitary body, leaving, however, a pit for
  its reception&mdash;the pituitary fossa. Cartilaginous capsules are formed round the cranial sense
  organs. The <i>auditory or periotic capsules</i> fuse on each side with the parachordals. The
  <i>optic capsules</i>, either fibrous or cartilaginous, remain free, and do not fuse with the
  adjacent trabecular region. The olfactory capsules alone are not developed independently, but are
  formed as lateral <span class="pagenum" id="page207"><span
  class="smaller">{207}</span></span>outgrowths from the mesethmoid plate. Later, the parachordals
  and trabeculae grow upwards on each side round the brain, and to a greater or less extent they
  meet and fuse on its dorsal surface, thus enclosing the latter organ in a cranial cavity, leaving,
  nevertheless, a large foramen behind (foramen magnum) through which the brain is continuous with
  the spinal cord. In this condition the primitive cartilaginous cranium, with its included
  sense-capsules, has reached a stage which is permanently retained in such Fishes as the
  Elasmobranchs.</p>

  <p>The <i>visceral arches</i> consist of a number of pairs of curved rods of cartilage, at first
  simple, but subsequently segmented, and developed in the splanchnic mesoblastic walls of the oral
  cavity and pharynx. Each rod is connected with its fellow by a median cartilage in the floor of
  the pharynx, so that the whole form a series of dorsally incomplete hoops encircling the anterior
  portion of the alimentary canal. No doubt all the visceral arches were originally branchial
  arches, and were so disposed between the successive gill-clefts as to support their walls and the
  vascular folds or gill-lamellae to which they gave rise. In Fishes most of the arches still retain
  their primitive gill-supporting function, but the first or mandibular arch has become modified to
  form upper and lower jaws, although in the Sharks and Dog-Fishes it may lie in front of a
  gill-cleft and still be associated with vestigial gills. The second or hyoid arch is less removed
  from the condition of a branchial arch, and generally supports either a functional or a vestigial
  gill, but in most Fishes it has acquired the secondary function of forming a suspensorium for the
  attachment of the jaws to the cranium.</p>

  <p>The skull of the common Dog-Fish, <i>Scyllium canicula</i> (Fig. 120),<a id="NtA_188"
  href="#Nt_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> may be studied as a type which in the adult remains
  cartilaginous, and has no secondary addition of cartilage- or membrane-bones. In this Fish the
  chondrocranium, or primary cartilaginous cranium, presents the appearance of a somewhat depressed
  oblong box, which has a complete roof, side-walls, and floor, but is open in front (<i>anterior
  cranial fontanelle</i>) and also behind (<i>foramen magnum</i>). The hinder, or parachordal
  portion of the cranium surrounds the foramen magnum, and there forms the <i>occipital region</i>.
  At the ventral margin of the foramen there are two prominences, or <i>occipital condyles</i>, for
  articulation with the first vertebra, and between them the remains of the notochord are traceable
  into the cranial floor.</p>

  <p>In front of the occipital region two lateral bulgings indicate the <i>periotic capsules</i>,
  and more anteriorly still, in the trabecular region, the sides of the cranium are modified to form
  two spacious lateral recesses, the <i>orbits</i>, each of which is bounded above and below by
  supra-orbital and infra-orbital ridges respectively, behind by an outgrowth from the periotic
  capsule (<i>post-orbital process</i>), and in front by a similar projection from the hinder wall
  of the olfactory capsule (<i>lateral ethmoidal process</i>). In front of the cranial cavity and
  the orbits may be seen the laterally-placed dome-like <i>olfactory capsules</i>, which are open
  below, where the nasal sacs communicate with the exterior. Between the two capsules an anterior
  extension of the cranial floor forms a flattened <i>mesethmoidal plate</i>, behind which is the
  large, membrane-closed, <i>anterior cranial fontanelle</i>. The lateral walls of the cranium are
  perforated by numerous apertures, some of which serve for the entrance or exit of blood-vessels,
  and others, mostly pertaining to the inner walls of the orbits, for the transmission of the
  different cranial nerves from the brain to <span class="pagenum" id="page209"><span
  class="smaller">{209}</span></span>various parts of the head. In many Elasmobranchs the roots of
  certain of the anterior spinal nerves perforate the side-walls of the occipital region, and
  indicate the fusion of vertebral components with the cranium. In the cranial roof between the two
  periotic capsules there are two small apertures at the bottom of a common median depression:
  through each aperture the ductus endolymphaticus (<i>aqueductus vestibuli</i>) passes from the
  vestibular part of the auditory organ to the exterior of the skull.</p>

  <p>Three cartilaginous rods, one from the roof of each olfactory capsule, and one, the
  <i>prenasal</i> or <i>rostral</i> process, from the ethmoid cartilage, converge and meet, or
  nearly meet, in front to form the rostrum or support for the preoral or "cut-water" portion of the
  head.</p>

  <p>The visceral arches are seven in number. The first or <i>mandibular arch</i> consists on each
  side of an upper portion, the <i>palato-pterygo-quadrate</i> or <i>palato-quadrate</i> cartilage,
  which passes forwards in the side-wall of the oral cavity, along the upper margin of the mouth,
  its anterior or palatine part curving inwards to a ligamentous connexion with its fellow beneath
  the cranial floor. Each cartilage has an upwardly directed process (<i>ethmo-palatine process</i>)
  which is connected by a suspensory <i>ethmo-palatine ligament</i> with the lateral wall of the
  cranium behind the lateral ethmoid process. The lower or ventral half of the mandibular arch
  (<i>Meckel's cartilage</i>) is similar in shape to the upper; it articulates behind with the
  quadrate portion of the latter by a movable joint, and is thence prolonged forwards and downwards
  in relation with the lower margin of the mouth to a median ligamentous union with its fellow of
  the opposite side. The palato-pterygo-quadrate and Meckel's cartilages together form the primitive
  upper and lower jaws, and support the teeth. The <i>hyoid arch</i> also consists of a dorsal and a
  ventral half on each side. The dorsal half or <i>hyomandibular</i> element articulates above with
  the periotic capsule. The ventral portion, or <i>cerato-hyal</i>, passes downwards and is
  connected with its fellow by a median copula or <i>basi-hyal</i> cartilage situated in the floor
  of the oral cavity. A series of simple cartilaginous rays (<i>branchial rays</i>) are attached to
  the hinder margins of the hyomandibular and cerato-hyal elements. The distal end of the
  hyomandibular is connected by strong ligaments with the hinder portions of both the
  palato-pterygo-quadrate cartilage and Meckel's cartilage; in fact, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page210"><span class="smaller">{210}</span></span>the hyomandibular is the effective
  suspensorium by which the upper and lower jaws are connected with the skull, and all Fishes in
  which this arrangement exists are said to be <i>hyostylic</i>.<a id="NtA_189"
  href="#Nt_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a> Behind the hyoid arch follow five <i>branchial arches</i>.
  Each of these is segmented into a dorsal or <i>pharyngo-branchial</i> element, followed by an
  <i>epi-</i>, a <i>cerato-</i>, and a <i>hypo-branchial</i> piece, but the later element is absent
  in the fifth arch. The lateral halves of the last three arches are connected ventrally by a large
  median basi-branchial cartilage, but in the first and second arches by the median apposition of
  their respective hypo-branchial elements. Like the hyomandibular and cerato-hyal segments of the
  hyoid arch, the epi- and cerato-branchial elements of all the branchial arches except the fifth
  are fringed along their outer convex margins by a series of <i>branchial rays</i>, and, in
  addition, there are three pairs of slender, curved, cartilaginous rods, or
  <i>extra-branchials</i>, in relation with the distal extremities of the branchial rays of the
  second, third, and fourth branchial arches. The function of the branchial arches, and their
  branchial rays, and extra-branchial cartilages, is to support the inter-branchial septa which
  separate the gill-clefts and carry the vascular gill lamellae. All the arches lie near the inner
  margins of the septa, close to the hypoblastic epithelium of the pharynx, while the outer portions
  of the septa are supported by the branchial rays and the extra-branchials, the latter lying
  directly beneath the external skin. The segments of the arches are movably connected with one
  another by ligaments; and by the contraction of the branchial muscles the arches may be separated
  or approximated so as to enlarge or diminish the size of the intervening clefts.</p>

  <p>The <i>labial cartilages</i> are represented by a pair of slender rods in relation with the
  outer surfaces of the palato-pterygo-quadrate cartilages, and a similar pair in connexion with the
  Meckelian cartilages. There is also a pair of small cartilages in relation with the nostrils. It
  is probable that the rods which constitute the lateral elements of the rostrum belong to the same
  category.</p>

  <p>In the Cyclostomes and the Elasmobranchs the skull is entirely cartilaginous, although it may
  often be superficially calcified in Elasmobranchs, and although there may even be definitely and
  symmetrically arranged calcified plates in <i>Pleuracanthus</i>, true bone is never present. In
  many Fishes, and notably in the Teleostomi, <span class="pagenum" id="page211"><span
  class="smaller">{211}</span></span>the embryonic cartilaginous cranium becomes complicated by the
  addition of an extensive series of investing membrane bones, formed by the ossification of the
  connective tissue external to the cartilage, so that a secondary bony cranium is formed external
  to the primary cranium much in the same way that a secondary pectoral girdle is formed in
  connexion with the primary girdle. Such bones probably owe their primary origin to the fusion and
  insinking of exoskeletal structures (scales or dermal spines). To these investing bones there may
  also be added a series of bones formed by the actual conversion of the cranial cartilage into
  osseous tissue (cartilage bones), which to a greater or less extent in different Fishes replaces
  the original cartilage. The bones of the skull may conveniently be classified as
  follows:&mdash;(i.) <i>Dermal or membrane bones</i>. Under this head are included&mdash;(<i>a</i>)
  the ordinary investing bones of the skull. (<i>b</i>) <i>Tooth-bones</i>, that is, bones formed by
  the fusion of the bases of teeth and developed in relation with the walls of the oral cavity.
  Probably all tooth-bearing bones are of this nature. (<i>c</i>) <i>Sensory canal bones</i>, that
  is, tubular bones developed round the sensory canals of the head. Certain of these bones may
  secondarily acquire the shape and character of investing bones while still retaining protective
  relations to their sensory canals. (ii.) <i>Cartilage bones</i>.</p>

  <p>As an easily obtainable example of a skull which has acquired a fairly complete series of both
  cartilage- and membrane-bones, while retaining a well-developed primary cranium, the skull of the
  Salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) may be described.<a id="NtA_190" href="#Nt_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a>
  At an early stage of development, even so late as the second week of hatching, the primary cranium
  is still entirely cartilaginous, and in this condition the Salmon's skull is comparable with that
  of an adult Dog-Fish. As development proceeds the primary cranium becomes supplemented by the
  addition of numerous investing dermal bones which form the secondary cranium, and later cartilage
  bones appear and, to a considerable extent, replace the original cartilage. The Salmon's skull is
  interesting in this respect, that the primary cranium grows with the growth of the Fish, so that
  in the adult the nasal, ethmoidal, and prenasal regions are entirely cartilaginous, and in the
  hinder part of the cranium cartilage is largely persistent between the cartilage bones.</p>

  <p>Dealing first with the cartilage bones of the primary cranium, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page212"><span class="smaller">{212}</span></span>it may be stated that there are formed in
  that part of the parachordal cartilage surrounding the foramen magnum a median
  <i>basioccipital</i> below, which is concave behind where it articulates with the centrum of the
  first vertebra, a <i>supraoccipital</i> above, and two laterally-placed <i>exoccipital</i> bones
  (Figs. 121, 122). Each periotic capsule is ossified by the formation of five bones in the
  primitively cartilaginous mass, the <i>prootic</i>, <i>sphenotic</i>, <i>opisthotic</i>,
  <i>epiotic</i>, and the <i>pterotic</i>. The inner walls of the capsules have atrophied in the
  adult, and hence the cavities which contain the auditory organs appear as open lateral recesses of
  the cranial cavity. In front of the periotic capsules there are various bones which are formed in
  the cartilage of the trabecular part of the cranium. Thus, in front of the basi-occipital, and
  developed in the cartilage of the cranial floor, there is a median <span class="sans
  fwb">Y</span>-shaped <i>basisphenoid</i>, and, at some distance above it on each side, an
  <i>alisphenoid</i> helps to form the lateral wall of the cranial cavity. Between the eyes the side
  walls of the cranium fuse to form a vertical inter-orbital septum, and, in consequence, two
  <i>orbito-sphenoid</i> bones, which normally form the lateral cranial walls in this region, become
  partially confluent in the median line and close the cranial cavity in front. The only cartilage
  bones found in the massive persistent portion of the primary cranium which forms the pre-orbital
  region are the projecting <i>lateral ethmoids</i>, forming the posterior boundaries of the
  recesses for the olfactory organs, and separating the latter from the orbits.</p>

  is a pair of small <i>parietals</i>, and anterior to the frontals a median <i>dermal
  mesethmoid</i>. A small <i>nasal</i> bone overlies each olfactory recess. Ventrally, the base of
  the cranium, from the basi-occipital to the prenasal region, is strengthened by a large
  <i>parasphenoid</i> behind, and a much smaller <i>vomer</i> in front, both of which lie in the

  <p>The mandibular arch (Fig. 123, B) is more modified than that of the Dog-Fish. The
  palato-pterygo-quadrate bars, or primitive upper jaw, no longer meet in front beneath the cranial
  floor, but each separately articulates in front with the lateral ethmoid of its side. Although
  still partly cartilaginous each bar is largely replaced either by cartilage bones, or by bones
  which begin as membrane bones or as tooth-bones and complete their growth by invading the
  cartilage and becoming in part cartilage bones. Its anterior portion is formed by a
  <i>palatine</i> bone which articulates with the lateral ethmoid, and the middle portion by a
  <i>pterygoid</i> and a <i>mesopterygoid</i> bone, while the hinder part is ossified above as a
  <i>metapterygoid</i> and below as a <i>quadrate</i>. The latter articulates with the lower jaw.
  Functionally, however, the primitive upper jaw is now replaced by a secondary upper jaw, formed on
  each side by a series of tooth-bones, situated external to the former, and meeting in front of the
  prenasal region of the primary cranium (Fig. 123, A). The series includes a dentigerous
  <i>premaxilla</i> and <i>maxilla</i>, and a small toothless, scale-like <i>jugal</i> bone. Each
  half of the lower jaw (Fig. 123, A, B) consists of a rod-like Meckel's cartilage or primary lower
  jaw.</p>

  <p>The hinder part of this is ossified to form the <i>articular</i>, which has a deeply concave
  surface for articulation with the quadrate; and below this there is a small membrane bone, the
  <i>angular</i>. The rest of the cartilage is partially <span class="pagenum" id="page215"><span
  class="smaller">{215}</span></span>ensheathed on its outer side by a large tooth-bone, the
  dentigerous <i>dentary</i>. The hyoid arch is similar to that of the Dog-Fish, except that its
  primitively cartilaginous segments are almost completely ossified (Fig. 123, B). The large upper
  segment or <i>hyomandibular</i> bone articulates mainly with the pterotic, but partly also with
  the sphenotic element of the periotic capsule; below it is connected with a slender
  <i>symplectic</i> bone, and from the cartilage connecting the two depends the rest of the hyoid
  arch, consisting in succession of <i>stylo-hyal</i>, <i>epi-hyal</i>, <i>cerato-hyal</i>, and
  <i>hypo-hyal</i> bones, with a median teeth-bearing <i>basi-hyal</i>. The palato-pterygo-quadrate
  bar has no direct connexion with the skull, except anteriorly where its palatine element
  articulates with the lateral ethmoid. The real suspensorium is formed by the hyomandibular and
  symplectic bones, to which the hinder margins of the quadrate and metapterygoid bones are rigidly
  attached by suture, hence, as in the Dog-Fish, the skull is hyostylic. Behind the hyoid arch there
  are five branchial arches, which generally resemble those of the Dog-Fish, except that their
  component segments are ossified as cartilage bones.</p>

  <p>Connected with the hyomandibular and cerato-hyal elements of the hyoid arch there is, on each
  side, a series of membrane bones for the support of the movable operculum or gill-cover. These
  consist of an <i>operculum</i> above, which articulates with a backwardly projecting process from
  the hyomandibular, followed in succession below by a <i>sub-operculum</i> and an
  <i>inter-operculum</i>, the latter being connected by ligament with the angle of the lower jaw.
  The series is completed by ten sabre-shaped <i>branchio-stegal rays</i>, which are attached to the
  cerato-hyal and support the lower margin of the gill-cover.</p>

  <p>Sensory canal bones are represented in the Salmon by a ring of small bony plates which encircle
  the orbit (Fig. 123, A), and by one or two small bones situated above and on the outer side of
  each periotic capsule (<i>squamosals</i>). To these may be added the <i>pre-operculum</i> situated
  external to the hinder margins of the hyomandibular and quadrate bones, firmly clamping these
  bones together, and also the <i>post-temporals</i>, by which the secondary pectoral girdle is
  attached to the skull. The <i>nasal</i> bones may also be regarded as pertaining to the same
  series.</p>

  <p>In other Fishes with a more or less complete bony skull there are certain additional cartilage-
  and membrane-bones which are not <span class="pagenum" id="page216"><span
  class="smaller">{216}</span></span>present in the Salmon. There is usually a median ossification
  of the ethmoid cartilage, the <i>mesethmoid</i>. An <i>entopterygoid</i> is sometimes added to the
  palato-pterygo-quadrate series of bones. An ossification of the anterior extremity of each
  Meckelian cartilage may form a <i>mento-Meckelian</i> bone. Certain additional membrane bones are
  sometimes developed in relation with the lower jaw, such as <i>splenial</i> and <i>coronary</i>
  bones on the inner side, and a <i>supra-angular</i> bone at the angle of the jaw, above the
  angular element. To these there may be added the singular series of <i>infra-dentaries</i>, which
  in some fossil Crossopterygii (e.g. <i>Rhizodopsis</i>) fringe the outer margin of the jaw beneath
  the true dentary (Fig. 274, A). A system of <i>jugular plates</i> may also form a characteristic
  armature for the throat between the lateral halves of the lower jaw (Fig. 274, C). Besides those
  already mentioned, additional sensory canal bones are present in some Fishes. A transverse row of
  plates (<i>supra-temporals</i>) sometimes crosses the occipital region behind the parietals. There
  are also other canal-ossicles which lose their identity by fusing with certain cranial or periotic
  bones. Thus, each of the pterotic and sphenotic bones often includes a superficial dermal bone
  transmitting a section of a sensory canal, which has fused with it; and as the frontal bone is
  often similarly perforated, it may be taken that it also includes a canal-ossicle; and the same
  can often be said of the articular and dentary bones of the lower jaw.<a id="NtA_191"
  href="#Nt_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Having now considered the general structure of a primitive cartilaginous type of skull, and the
  nature, disposition, and terminology of the various membrane- and cartilage-bones which may be
  added to, or more or less completely replace the former, reference will now be made to the more
  important features in the structure of the skull in the Cyclostomata and the Fishes.</p>

  <p>In the Cyclostomata the skull presents a remarkable combination of characters, in some of which
  it is more primitive than in any other Craniates, while in others it has evidently attained a very
  high degree of specialisation on lines peculiar to the group, but differing in the two
  subdivisions.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the Lamprey<a id="NtA_192" href="#Nt_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a> (Fig. 124) the paired
  parachordals and trabeculae together form a trough-like chondrocranium, which has only a fibrous
  roof, except where a slender <i>synotic</i> band of cartilage extends between the two periotic
  capsules. The floor is also incomplete, a large pituitary fontanelle remaining to indicate the
  original separation of the trabeculae while transmitting the hypophysial or pituitary caecum. The
  notochord traverses the floor of the parachordal portion of the cranium as far as the pituitary
  fontanelle, and from the sides of the synotic ring the auditory capsules project in the shape of
  conspicuous lateral prominences. In front the otherwise open end of the cranial cavity is closed
  by the dorsally-placed and unpaired olfactory capsule, which is perforated behind by two apertures
  for the olfactory nerves, and has only a fibrous connexion with the cranial walls. Anteriorly to
  the olfactory capsule the cranial floor is prolonged forwards over the roof of the mouth as a
  large laterally-expanded plate, formed by the united anterior portions of the trabeculae, and no
  doubt representing the <i>mesethmoid</i> cartilage of the Dog-Fish. So far the cranium presents no
  special difficulty, and in its general features may be readily compared with that of an embryonic
  Elasmobranch. As for the rest of the skull, it is obvious that it has been greatly modified,
  partly to form and to support the skeletal framework of the remarkable suctorial buccal funnel,
  and partly to form the singular rasping lingual apparatus. Hence it is always difficult and
  sometimes impossible to identify with <span class="pagenum" id="page218"><span
  class="smaller">{218}</span></span>certainty the component parts as being represented in other
  Craniates. On each side of the cranium, beneath the eye, there is a characteristic <span
  class="sans fwb">V</span>-shaped <i>subocular arch</i>. Of its two legs the hinder one is
  continuous above with the periotic region of the cranium, and the other with the anterior
  trabecular region, while the pointed apex is directed obliquely downward and forward. From the
  hinder margin of the posterior limb a slender <i>styloid process</i> passes downward in the side
  wall of the pharynx, and terminates below in a forwardly directed <i>cornual</i> cartilage. A
  velum, fringed along its free margin with a series of tentacles, projects forwards into the oral
  cavity from between the oral apertures of the oesophagus and the branchial canal, and probably
  serves to prevent the entrance of foreign particles to the gill-sacs. This valve-like velum is
  supported by a <i>velar skeleton</i>, consisting of two lateral cartilages which are prolonged
  into the tentacles, and extend transversely between the inner surfaces of the two styloid
  processes. The apex of each subocular arch is connected with a small and somewhat triangular
  cartilage (<i>postero-lateral cartilage</i>), which is directed upward and forward, and lies in
  the side wall of the oral cavity. With some degree of probability the subocular arch may be
  compared to the palato-quadrate cartilage of a skull which has become "autostylic" in order to
  form a rigid support for the skeleton of the buccal funnel; the styloid processes and cornual
  cartilages to the hyoid arch; while the relations of the posterior lateral cartilages to the
  subocular arches suggest that they may possibly be regarded as Meckelian cartilages which have
  lost their primitive function of forming biting jaws. In the median line below, and projecting
  backward for some distance beneath the branchial canal, there is a long and stout <i>lingual</i>
  cartilage, carrying a small median and a still smaller pair of lateral cartilages at its anterior
  extremity, where it supports the lingual teeth and projects into the buccal funnel beneath the
  mouth. In front of the lingual cartilage, and connected by fibrous tissue with the inferior and
  hinder margin of the <i>annular</i> cartilage, there is a median <span class="sans
  fwb">T</span>-shaped element, the <i>median ventral</i> cartilage. It has been conjectured that
  the lingual cartilage is a free basi-hyal element, and the median ventral cartilage the
  equivalent, elsewhere unknown, of the corresponding element of the mandibular arch.<a id="NtA_193"
  href="#Nt_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page219"><span class="smaller">{219}</span></span></div>

  <p>The remaining anterior skull elements are principally skeletal supports for the roof and walls
  of the buccal funnel. The roof is supported by an extended <i>anterior dorsal</i> cartilage, which
  is overlapped behind by the ethmoid cartilage, while the circular margin of the funnel is
  strengthened by a large ring-like <i>annular</i> cartilage. On each side of the latter there is a
  slender, rod-like, <i>styloid</i> cartilage, and above the latter a small <i>anterior lateral</i>
  cartilage. All these cartilages are usually termed labial cartilages, and it is at least possible
  that they possess representatives in the similarly named structures of the Dog-Fish and the larvae
  of some of the tailless Amphibia. It must not be forgotten, however, that the annular cartilage
  bears some resemblance to the ring of cartilage which encircles the lips of the buccal cavity in
  Amphioxus.</p>

  <p>The complex supporting skeleton of the gill-sacs forms a basket-like structure. It consists on
  each side of nine unsegmented, irregularly curved, and slightly branched cartilaginous rods,
  situated in the outer margins of the inter-branchial septa, directly internal to the skin. The
  first lies directly behind the styloid process (hyoid arch), the second and third in front of and
  behind the first gill-sac, and of the remainder one lies just behind each of the six succeeding
  gill-openings; above and below each gill-aperture the rods are connected by longitudinal bars, and
  also in the median ventral line by a pair of similar partially united bars. The dorsal ends of the
  rods are also connected on each side by another longitudinal bar, which runs alongside the
  notochord and in front blends with the chondrocranium. The rods forming the last pair are
  continuous with a cup-like cartilage, supporting the lateral and hinder walls of the
  pericardium.</p>

  <p>This singular branchial basket undoubtedly bears a superficial resemblance to the branchial
  arches of Fishes, but in any comparison of the two structures it is well to bear in mind that the
  branchial rods of the Lamprey are situated along the outer edges of the inter-branchial septa, and
  are therefore external to the gill-sacs and branchial arteries, and further, that they are
  developed in the somatic mesoblast of the embryonic protovertebrae, whereas true branchial arches
  are situated at the inner margins of the septa, internal to the gill-clefts and branchial
  arteries, and have their origin from the splanchnic layer of the mesoblast. So far as their
  position is concerned, the rods agree rather with the <span class="pagenum" id="page220"><span
  class="smaller">{220}</span></span>extra-branchial cartilages of an Elasmobranch than with the
  more deeply-seated branchial arches.</p>

  <p>While the skull of the Myxinoid Cyclostomes<a id="NtA_194" href="#Nt_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a>
  is constructed on the same general lines as that of the Lamprey, it is in some respects more
  primitive. It is also clear that in other features the skull has undergone marked specialisation
  on lines of its own, and in some points again it seems to deviate less from the more normal
  Craniate type. Of the more obvious differences, as illustrated by the skull of <i>Bdellostoma</i>
  (Figs. 125-127), it will be sufficient here to mention the following: (i.) The more primitive
  condition of the chondrocranium, the roof and side walls of the cranial cavity being entirely
  membranous. (ii.) The non-development of a suctorial buccal funnel and the presence of oral
  tentacles, associated with the absence of the complex system of labial cartilages and the
  substitution of a special tentacular skeleton. (iii.) The special modifications induced by the
  length and physiological importance of the naso-pituitary canal and by its communication with the
  pharynx after perforating the pituitary fontanelle in the cranial floor.</p>

  <p> Under this head may be included the depression of the mesethmoid or hypophysial plate for the
  support of the naso-pituitary canal, the forward prolongation and median union of the
  palato-quadrate cartilages of opposite sides beneath the external portion of the canal, apparently
  for the support of the latter, and the encircling of the canal by supporting annular rings of
  cartilage. (iv.) The presence of two branchial arches, connected, as in Fishes, with a median
  basi-branchial segment which forms the middle one of the three divisions of the lingual apparatus.
  (v.) The reduction of the complicated extra-branchial basket to small isolated cartilages in
  relation with the gill-apertures and the &#x0153;sophago-cutaneous duct. (vi.) The extraordinary
  development of the lingual apparatus, of which it has <span class="pagenum" id="page222"><span
  class="smaller">{222}</span></span>been remarked that it "dominates the whole body, everything

  <p>In the generality of Elasmobranchs the skull resembles that of the Dog-Fish in essential
  structure. The more important modifications within the limits of the group relate to differences
  in the mode of attachment of the primitive upper jaw to the skull, and the number of branchial
  arches. In most Elasmobranchs the skull is hyostylic, as in <i>Scyllium</i>, but there are two
  genera which, in different ways, are exceptions to this rule. In <i>Notidanus</i> the hinder part
  of each palato-quadrate cartilage grows upwards into a strong post-orbital process, which
  articulates with the suitably modified post-orbital process of the periotic capsule (Fig. 128);
  hence the primitive upper jaw acquires a direct dorsal connexion with the cranium, and, as the
  hyoid arch is now relieved from taking any part in its support, the hyomandibular is reduced to
  the condition of a relatively slender rod of cartilage. By this arrangement both the mandibular
  and hyoid arches have their own separate and independent connexions with the cranium, and the
  skull is said to be <i>amphistylic</i>.<a id="NtA_195" href="#Nt_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a> The
  Port Jackson Shark <span class="pagenum" id="page223"><span
  class="smaller">{223}</span></span>(<i>Heterodontus</i>) exhibits another and quite different
  modification. In this Fish the dorsal border of each palato-quadrate cartilage fits into a deep
  groove along the infero-lateral surface of the cranium, and is firmly attached thereto by
  ligament. Thus the first step is taken towards that more complete fusion of the two structures
  which is so characteristic a feature in the more typically <i>autostylic</i> Fishes like the
  Holocephali and the Dipnoi. Autostylism, whether incipient, as in <i>Heterodontus</i>, or
  complete, is to be regarded as a secondary modification, which may be independently acquired in
  widely different groups of Fishes, and is usually associated with the need of a firm and rigid
  support for an exceptionally massive dentition.<a id="NtA_196"

  <p>In the Holocephali (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Chimaera</i><a id="NtA_197"
  href="#Nt_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a>) the cranium retains its primitively cartilaginous condition,
  and assumes a somewhat peculiar appearance owing to the lateral compression and vertical growth of
  its inter-orbital and nasal regions (Fig. 129). There is a complicated series of labial cartilages
  in relation with the ventrally-placed nostrils and the upper and lower jaws. In the males of
  <i>Chimaera</i> and <i>Callorhynchus</i>, but not in <i>Harriotta</i>, a movable cartilage is
  attached to the cranial roof, and supports the frontal clasper. The skull is typically autostylic.
  Along <span class="pagenum" id="page224"><span class="smaller">{224}</span></span>the whole length
  of its dorsal border the palato-quadrate cartilage is fused with the inferior lateral margin of
  the cranium from the periotic to the olfactory region, thus forming a triangular plate of
  cartilage, the base of which is continuous with the cranium, while the downwardly directed apex
  provides an articular surface for the lower jaw. The hyoid arch is little better developed than
  the succeeding branchial arches, and includes a vestigial hyomandibular, an epi-hyal, and a
  cerato-hyal. As in other autostylic skulls the hyomandibular element is attached by ligament to
  the hinder margin of the palato-quadrate, instead of being directly connected with the periotic
  capsule, and obviously takes no part in supporting the jaws. Branchial rays for the support of the
  operculum are attached to the cerato-hyal, and some of them have their bases fused together. The
  five branchial arches resemble those of the Dog-Fish, except that they tend to become concentrated
  beneath the skull.</p>

  <p>Numerous dermal bones invest the dorsal surface of the chondrocranium, and only to a limited
  extent correspond with the less numerous membrane bones of the Salmon. To these are added a series
  of circum-orbital bones and a large parasphenoid. Undoubtedly the most striking feature in these
  Fishes is the primitive character of the upper jaw. In <i>Polyodon</i> (Fig. 131) the
  palato-quadrates are wholly cartilaginous, and, as in the Dog-Fish, they meet in front beneath the
  basis cranii, where the two are connected by ligament. The secondary upper jaw is but feebly
  developed, and is represented on each side by a thin splint-like maxilla in relation with the
  outer surface of each palato-quadrate cartilage, which meets its fellow in front. There are no
  premaxillae. The lower jaw is also very primitive. Meckel's cartilages are persistent, and except
  for a mento-Meckelian bone on each side, they are unossified, although membrane bones representing
  dentary and splenial elements are present. The skull is hyostylic. The hyoid and branchial arches
  are only partially ossified. Each opercular fold is supported by an operculum and an
  interoperculum, and both of these retain somewhat the shape of the cartilaginous hyoidean rays
  which they have replaced. In the Sturgeon (Fig. 130) the upper jaw is greatly modified in relation
  with the singular mouth of this Fish. The palato-quadrate cartilages meet not only in front, but
  also along their dorsal margins, and, with the help of the similarly opposed and somewhat
  fragmentary metapterygoid <span class="pagenum" id="page226"><span
  class="smaller">{226}</span></span>cartilages, they form a complete concave roof for the
  protrusible spout-like mouth. Palatine, mesopterygoid, and pterygoid bones invest, and in some
  measure replace these cartilages. In brief, the skull of the Chondrostei occupies an interesting
  intermediate position between the purely cartilaginous and mainly bony types. While retaining a
  well-developed and unossified primary cranium, it has acquired a complete secondary cranium of
  dermal bones. Equally notable is the condition of the jaws. Unique among the Teleostomi in
  possessing the typical Elasmobranch union of the palato-quadrate cartilages beneath the basis
  cranii, the Chondrostei are so far specialised that they have acquired certain of the membrane
  bones which constitute the secondary jaws of the more typical bony Fishes.</p>

  <p>As regards the general structure of the skull and the nature and disposition of its cartilage-
  and membrane-bones, the remaining living Teleostomi have much in common with the Salmon. In all
  the skull is hyostylic, and, unlike the Chondrostei, each half of the primitive upper jaw remains
  distinct from its fellow, and is separately articulated in front with the lateral ethmoid of the
  same side by its palatine element. The palato-quadrate cartilage is always more or less completely
  replaced by bones similar to those of the Salmon, and although they often carry teeth, as a rule
  they do little more than constitute a rigid buttress for the fixation of the quadrate condyle for
  the lower jaw. The secondary upper jaw is nearly always well developed, and includes a premaxilla
  as well as a maxilla on each side. There are, however, certain features in each of the minor
  groups which are either distinctive or highly characteristic.</p>

  <p>In the surviving Crossopterygii (e.g. <i>Polypterus</i><a id="NtA_199"
  href="#Nt_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a>) the chondro-cranium is complete in the ethmoidal and
  post-orbital regions, except where it has been partially replaced by cartilage bones, but in the
  inter-orbital region the continuity of the roof is interrupted by a large fontanelle, which is
  only closed by the investing frontal bones (Fig. 132, C). There is also a large basi-cranial
  fontanelle in the sphenethmoid, closed, however, by the underlying parasphenoid. A large
  "occipital" bone continuously ossifies in the occipital cartilage and completely surrounds the
  foramen magnum.</p>

  <p>Prootics and pterotics are absent, and the opisthotics seem to be confluent with their
  respective epiotics. The floor and side walls of the inter-orbital section of the cranium are
  formed by a remarkable "sphenethmoid" bone which occupies the position of the paired ali- and
  orbito-sphenoids in other bony Fishes; and in one species, <i>P. lapradei</i>,<a id="NtA_200"
  href="#Nt_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a> it forms in front distinct tubular investments round the
  olfactory nerves. In many respects this bone is singularly like the sphenethmoid bone of the Frog
  and other tailless Amphibia. A median ethmoid as well as lateral ethmoids are present. In addition
  to the ordinary dermal bones which invest the cranial roof there is a transverse row of
  supra-temporal plates crossing the cranial roof behind the paired parietals (Fig. 132, A).
  Fringing the outer margins of the frontals and parietals a row of pre- and post-spiracular
  ossicles extends nearly to the orbits, and between two of them, which form a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page228"><span class="smaller">{228}</span></span>valve, is the spiracular aperture itself.
  There is a dentigerous splenial on the inner surface of the lower jaw. The hyoid arch has no
  separate symplectic bone. An operculum and a suboperculum are present, but no inter-operculum; and
  unless the hinder part of the large cheek-plate, which is traversed by the mandibulo-hyoid sensory
  canal, represents a pre-operculum, the latter is wanting. Branchiostegal rays are absent, but
  there is a single pair of large jugular plates.</p>

  <p>Very little is certainly known about the cranial cartilage-bones in the fossil members of the
  group, but the investing dermal bones, which bear a general resemblance to those of
  <i>Polypterus</i>, are often somewhat more numerous, and they form a very complete dermal armature
  for the entire head. There is a very complete ring of circum-orbital bones, and very often a ring
  of sclerotic plates. Two large cheek-plates are often present. Nothing comparable to pre- and
  post-spiracular ossicles is known, but squamosal and supra-temporals can often be identified. To
  the ordinary bones of the lower jaw there may be added a series of infra-dentary plates, and
  besides the paired principal jugular plates there may also be present a small anterior median
  plate and a series of small lateral jugular plates on each side, as in the Carboniferous
  <i>Rhizodopsis</i> (Fig. 274). Most of the superficial dermal bones, both in the living and
  extinct Crossopterygii, are invested externally by a granulated or rugose layer of enamel-like
  ganoin.</p>

  <p>In the Holostei, and especially in <i>Amia</i>, the skull approximates more closely to the
  normal Teleostean type as represented by the Salmon's skull. In <i>Amia</i><a id="NtA_201"
  href="#Nt_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a> all the occipital cartilage-bones are present&mdash;a
  basi-occipital, two exoccipitals, and a supra-occipital; and, except for the absence of a
  pterotic, the periotic series of bones is also complete. Paired ali- and orbito-sphenoids form the
  lateral walls of the inter-orbital portion of the cranial cavity. Above, the complete
  cartilaginous roof of the cranial cavity is invested by a shield of suturally united and
  ganoin-covered dermal plates. The hyomandibular element has a symplectic bone at its distal
  extremity. There is a complete series of opercular bones, and the branchiostegal rays are
  numerous. A single median jugular plate is present. The lower jaw has on each side five
  dentigerous splenial bones in addition to dentary and angular bones, while cartilage-bones are
  <span class="pagenum" id="page229"><span class="smaller">{229}</span></span>represented by
  articular and mento-Meckelian elements. In its essential structure the skull of
  <i>Lepidosteus</i><a id="NtA_202" href="#Nt_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> resembles that of
  <i>Amia</i>, but it has obviously undergone much specialisation. In some species (<i>e.g.</i>
  <i>L. osseus</i>) its appearance is greatly modified by the exceptional length and tapering shape
  of the beak, due to the elongation of that part of the skull which lies between the orbital and
  nasal regions; but in <i>L. platycephalus</i> the reduced length and greater width of the beak,
  combined with its somewhat flattened condition, impart an almost Crocodilian aspect to the head.
  Amongst other points of difference it may be mentioned that in <i>Lepidosteus</i> the continuity
  of the chondro-cranial roof is interrupted by a large superior fontanelle. There is no
  supra-occipital, and there are no lateral ethmoids, at all events in the usual position. The
  inter-orbital portion of the cranial cavity is largely obliterated by the formation of an
  inter-orbital septum, consisting of a thin vertical plate of bone, which either represents a pair
  of fused orbito-sphenoids or a pair of similarly modified lateral ethmoids. In addition to the
  ordinary investing dermal bones, including circum-orbitals, squamosal, and supra-temporals, there
  are numerous scale-like ossicles which take the place of the cheek-plates of <i>Polypterus</i>.
  The maxillae are segmented into numerous dentigerous bones fringing the margins of the upper jaw.
  The lower jaw has no mento-Meckelian bones, but there is a very complete series of dermal
  elements, including dentary, coronary, splenial, angular, and supra-angular bones in addition to
  an articular cartilage-bone. One of the most remarkable features in the skull of
  <i>Lepidosteus</i> is the existence of a secondary articulation between the metapterygoid bones
  and a pair of transversely elongated condyles formed on each side by a lateral outgrowth from the
  parasphenoid and alisphenoid bones. By a horizontal sliding movement of the former on the latter,
  provision is made for the lateral expansion and contraction of the walls of the oral cavity and
  the separation and approximation of the lateral halves of the upper jaw.<a id="NtA_203"
  href="#Nt_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The generality of Teleosts<a id="NtA_204" href="#Nt_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a> more or less
  closely agree with <i>Amia</i> in the main features of their cranial structure. There are,
  however, certain minor features which are characteristic if not <span class="pagenum"
  id="page230"><span class="smaller">{230}</span></span>always distinctive of the group. As a rule,
  to which, nevertheless, there are notable exceptions, there is little of the primary cartilaginous
  cranium in the adult, nearly the whole of it having become absorbed or converted into
  cartilage-bones. A supraoccipital is invariably present, and usually a mesethmoid and a
  basisphenoid. An additional bone is added to the periotic series, viz. a pterotic. Supra-temporal
  bones and jugular plates are always absent, and it may be doubted if mento-Meckelian bones and
  dentigerous splenials are ever developed in the lower jaw. Within the group itself the skull
  exhibits many notable modifications, of which only a few can here be mentioned. The shape, size,
  and character of the mouth and jaws, the extent to which they can be protruded and retracted, and
  the nature of the dentition, are the source of many characteristic modifications in the structure
  and appearance of the fore-part of the skull, and these again largely depend upon differences of
  habit and food. A protrusible mouth, or a mouth which is projected forwards, is usually associated
  with a suspensorium (hyomandibular) of considerable length, and so greatly inclined forwards as to
  make a more or less acute angle with the forepart of the cranium.</p>

  <p>The presence or absence of an inter-orbital septum is also a feature in which considerable
  variation occurs. In some Teleosts there is no septum, and the cranial cavity is prolonged
  forwards between the orbits, where its lateral walls are formed by well-developed, paired ali- and
  orbito-sphenoid bones, as, for example, in the Carp and other Cyprinidae. In others the fusion of
  the cranial walls is accompanied by the median union of the orbito-sphenoids, so that a partly
  bony and partly cartilaginous inter-orbital septum is found, and the cranial cavity becomes
  largely obliterated in this region, as in the Salmon; or the orbito-sphenoids may be non-existent,
  the cartilage may undergo absorption, and the inter-orbital septum may become reduced to a
  vertical fibrous sheath extending between the frontals above and the parasphenoid below, as is the
  case in the Cod (<i>Gadus</i>).</p>

  <p>An interesting modification of certain of the bones of the primary and secondary upper jaw
  occurs in the Siluridae. In these Fishes the maxillae are very small and edentulous, and serve no
  other purpose than forming basal supports for the maxillary barbels, while the rod-like palatine
  bone, losing its connexion with the pterygoid portion of the primitive upper jaw, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page231"><span class="smaller">{231}</span></span>but retaining its
  articulation with the lateral ethmoid, serves to support the maxilla, and at the same time
  receives the insertion of the muscles by which the barbel is moved in various directions.</p>

  <p>In the Plectognathi the premaxillae are co-ossified with the maxillae. Many other interesting
  cranial modifications occur in Teleosts, and to some of them reference is made in subsequent
  chapters.</p>

  <p>In some respects the skull of Dipnoi<a id="NtA_205" href="#Nt_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a> is
  remarkably like that of the Holocephali, especially in its typical autostylism; but in possessing
  both cartilage- and membrane-bones it in some measure approaches the Teleostome skull. The
  investing dermal bones are not always easy to identify with those of other Fishes. In
  <i>Neoceratodus</i> an anterior median membrane-bone or dermal mesethmoid covers the ethmo-nasal
  region, and, on each side of it, forming the anterior boundary of the orbit, there is situated a
  pre-orbital or dermal lateral ethmoid. Behind the mesethmoid there is a much larger posterior
  median bone, and on each side a singular backward prolongation of the dermal lateral ethmoid
  separates it from a squamosal element. The latter bone descends on the outer surface of the
  quadrate portion of the palato-quadrate cartilage as far as the condyle for the lower jaw.
  Collectively, these bones form a fairly complete investment to the upper surface of the cranium,
  but the posterior median bone and the adjacent portions of the dermal lateral ethmoid and the
  squamosal are widely separated from the underlying chondrocranium by the powerful jaw muscles, and
  in this respect they differ from the ordinary roofing bones of other Fishes.</p>

  <p>In <i>Protopterus</i> (Fig. 133) and <i>Lepidosiren</i> (Fig. 134) the posterior median bone is
  non-existent, and its place is taken by a large fronto-parietal, which forms the greater part of
  the cranial roof, internal to the jaw muscles, and is much larger in the latter Dipnoid than in
  the former. Circum-orbital bones are present only in <i>Neoceratodus</i>. A large parasphenoid
  supports the cranial floor. Vomers are absent, although there are two small vomerine teeth.</p>

  <p>Relatively small opercular and inter-opercular bones are present, and on the inner surface of
  each may be found vestigial remains of cartilaginous hyoidean rays. The chondrocranium is complete
  in <i>Neoceratodus</i>, but in the remaining genera it has undergone considerable absorption in
  the inter-orbital region, so that the roof and floor, and, in part, even the side walls of the
  cranial cavity, are formed by the fronto-parietal and parasphenoid bones. Two exoccipitals are
  present in all Dipnoi. There are small labial cartilages in relation with the ventrally-placed
  nostrils, and large lateral outgrowths from the ethmoid cartilage furnish the olfactory organs
  with conspicuous lattice-like roofs. A pair of strong palato-pterygoid bones fringe the lower
  margins of the palato-quadrate cartilage, and meeting in front beneath the ethmoid region their
  symphysial extremities support the large palatal teeth. The Meckelian cartilages are persistent in
  all Dipnoi. In <i>Neoceratodus</i> each is flanked by a dentary and an angular externally, and
  internally by a splenial; but in <i>Protopterus</i> and <i>Lepidosiren</i> distinct dentary bones
  are wanting. The hyoid arch is best <span class="pagenum" id="page233"><span

  href="#Nt_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a> and includes a small hyomandibular cartilage, a partially bony
  cerato-hyal and cartilaginous hypo-hyal and basi-hyal element. In the other genera (Fig. 133) only
  a cerato-hyal is retained. The branchial arches are but feebly developed in the Dipnoi.
  <i>Neoceratodus</i> has five, of which the first four are divided into epi-branchial and

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>The Median Fins.</b>&mdash;Whether existing in the form of a continuous fin, or as
  discontinuous isolated fins, the median fins are provided with skeletal supports, and also with
  muscles, primitively formed from intrusive clusters of cells derived from a variable number of the
  neighbouring myotomes, for their varied movements. The skeletal structures of the dorsal and anal
  fins consist of a series of bony or cartilaginous, rod-like, and typically tri-segmented radial
  elements or pterygiophores,<a id="NtA_209" href="#Nt_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a> supporting distally
  a series of dermal structures in the shape of numerous slender horny fibres or ceratotrichia, as
  in the Elasmobranchii and Holocephali, or a smaller number of bony dermal fin-rays, which are
  probably modified scales or lepidotrichia,<a id="NtA_210" href="#Nt_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a> as
  in the Teleostomi. The typical tri-segmented character of the radialia is often retained in many
  existing Elasmobranchs (Fig. 135) and in <i>Pleuracanthus</i>, in <i>Neoceratodus</i> amongst the
  Dipnoi, in the Chondrostei, in existing Holostei (Fig. 136), and to a greater or less extent in
  several families of Teleosts (<i>e.g.</i> Salmonidae, Esocidae, Cyprinidae, and some
  Acanthopterygii); but in the latter group the radialia are greatly prone to reduction, and hence
  they are more generally bi-segmented, and sometimes consist of a single proximal segment only
  (e.g. <i>Gymnotus</i>). In all these Fishes the proximal segments are the longest and the most
  persistent, and when reduction occurs it is at the expense of the middle and distal segments.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The cause of this reduction is often, but not always, to be found in the fact that, whenever
  the dermal fin-rays take the form of stout spines, as in the anterior dorsal fin in many
  Acanthopterygian Teleostei, the segmentation of their radialia would obviously detract from their
  value as skeletal supports, and hence they rarely consist of more than their proximal segments,
  although the radialia which in the same Fish support soft rays may be bi-segmented or
  tri-segmented. The radialia are, however, unsegmented, even slightly branched, cartilaginous rods
  in the Cyclostomata; short simple rods in the Holocephali; and equally simple bony rods in the
  dorsal fin of <i>Polypterus</i>, where they support the strong spines of the numerous finlets; but
  they are bi-segmented in the soft-rayed anal fin. As previously mentioned, the proportional share
  taken by the radialia and the horny fibres or the dermal fin-rays in the support of the fins
  differs greatly in different Fishes. In the Cyclostomata radialia are the sole, and in
  Elasmobranchs the main supports, and they may extend nearly to the free margin of the fin. In the
  more specialised Fishes, as in most Teleostomi, the reverse is the case. The radialia sink into
  the muscles of the body-wall and leave the strongly developed fin-rays as the sole support of the
  visible portions of the fins. In not a few Fishes there is an obvious segmental correspondence
  between the radialia and the vertebral neural or haemal spines, to the extent that the former
  equal the latter in number and articulate with their distal extremities, as, for example, in the
  caudal region of <i>Pleuracanthus</i> and in existing <span class="pagenum" id="page236"><span
  class="smaller">{236}</span></span>Dipnoi.  In others again, as in most Teleostomi, there is no
  such segmental relation, and the radialia are more numerous than the vertebrae whenever the two
  are co-extensive. The exoskeletal fin-supports exhibit similar relations to their radialia, but in
  inverse order. Much more numerous than the radialia in the Elasmobranchs, Holocephali, and the
  Dipnoi, the former become gradually reduced in the Teleostomi, until in the Holostei and Teleostei
  they correspond in number with the supporting radialia. Complete numerical correspondence between
  the neural and haemal spines and the radialia and fin-rays is very rare, and has only been
  observed in the caudal region of certain Crossopterygii (<i>e.g.</i> the Coelacanthidae).<a

  <p>In not a few Fishes the radialia of the median fins undergo modifications which offer an
  interesting parallel to an early stage in the evolution of the paired fins from primitively
  continuous lateral fins. The concentration of radialia which occurs in isolated median fins often
  results, through growth pressure, in the complete fusion of the proximal segments of more or fewer
  of the radialia into two or three basal supports, or even into a single basal piece. Examples of
  such basal fusion are frequent in the dorsal fins of Elasmobranchs, and the same modification may
  also be seen in the anal fin of <i>Pleuracanthus</i>, and especially in the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page237"><span class="smaller">{237}</span></span>dorsal fin of the Devonian Crossopterygian,
  <i>Holoptychius</i><a id="NtA_212" href="#Nt_212"><sup>[212]</sup></a> (Fig. 138), where several
  radialia, which are free distally, have their bases united into a single basal piece, or
  basipterygium. In most Teleostomi elevator and depressor muscles arise from the radialia, and are
  inserted into different points on the bases of the fin-rays, and by their contraction the latter
  may either be elevated into an erect position, or folded back like a fan along the middle line of
  the body, where, as in some Teleosts, there is a groove for their reception. When fin-rays are
  only capable of simple elevation or depression, the connexion between a radial element and its
  fin-ray is usually by some form of a hinge-joint, the cleft base of the ray clipping the distal
  segment of the radial (Fig. 139). In some Teleosts the articulation of the two is by means of a
  kind of chain-link (Fig. 137). In those Fishes in which the median fins are capable of lateral
  undulatory movements the articulation is of a more mobile character.</p>

  <p>In the different types of caudal fin, diphycercal, heterocercal, and homocercal, the supporting
  elements of the ventral lobe are formed by the haemal spines of the terminal caudal vertebrae
  which are inclined backwards, and are often greatly expanded for the purpose (Fig. 140). The
  dorsal lobe may be supported either by the adjacent neural spines, or by radialia, or by both.</p>

  <p><b>The Appendicular Skeleton.</b><a id="NtA_213" href="#Nt_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a>&mdash;It
  is probable that the skeleton of the paired fins and the pectoral and pelvic girdles have been
  formed from the supporting radialia of the isolated and enlarged anterior and posterior portions
  of primitively continuous lateral <span class="pagenum" id="page238"><span
  class="smaller">{238}</span></span>fins, by a sequence of structural modifications in the same
  direction as in the median fins. The initial stage was probably marked by the fusion of the
  proximal portions of the radialia to form a basal support or basipterygium for the free distal
  portions. Subsequently, it may be, a rudiment of the future limb-girdle became segmented off from
  the inner extremity of the basipterygium, and by its dorsal and ventral growth in the body-wall
  the lateral half of a girdle was developed. The subsequent union of the two halves across the
  mid-ventral line resulted in the evolution of the dorsally incomplete hoop of cartilage which is
  the primary form of the complete limb-girdle in Craniates. The primitive fin skeleton or
  "archipterygium" was formed from the residue of the basipterygium in conjunction with the free
  distal radialia which it carried. The precise structure of the archipterygium is purely
  hypothetical. Possibly it was a biserial fin of the <i>Pleuracanthus</i> or <i>Neoceratodus</i>
  type, consisting of a cartilaginous segmented axis, fringed along its anterior and posterior, or
  pre-axial and post-axial margins, by a series of slender, simple, or jointed radialia (Fig. 147);
  or it may have been a uniserial structure, somewhat resembling the pelvic fin of
  <i>Pleuracanthus</i>, or the pectoral and pelvic fins of existing Elasmobranchs (Figs. 250, 141),
  in which an axis formed by the residue of the basipterygium or metapterygium had a fringe of
  radialia on its anterior or preaxial side only. If the archipterygium was biserial then the
  uniserial fin was probably derived from it by the subsequent suppression of all the post-axial
  radialia; or, if uniserial, the biserial fin was evolved by a later extension of radialia on to
  the post-axial margin. The evidence of comparative anatomy is not conclusive as to the nature of
  the archipterygium, and palaeontology seems to support either view with puzzling impartiality.<a
  id="NtA_214" href="#Nt_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a> It may be admitted that the lateral fin theory
  offers the best solution of the problem of the origin of the paired fins, but it must be borne in
  mind that no Fish, living or fossil, is known to possess fins of this nature, unless the singular
  lateral lobes of some Ostracodermi (<i>e.g.</i> the Coelolepidae) are kindred organs<a
  id="NtA_215" href="#Nt_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a>; neither do continuous lateral fins ever exist as
  vestiges, unless, indeed, the bilateral series of spines, which extend between the pectoral and
  pelvic <span class="pagenum" id="page239"><span class="smaller">{239}</span></span>fins, in some
  of the Lower Devonian Acanthodei (e.g. <i>Climatius</i>), may be regarded in that light.</p>

  <p><i>The Pectoral and Pelvic Girdles</i>.&mdash;The pectoral girdle is more primitive in
  <i>Cladoselache</i> and <i>Pleuracanthus</i> than in any other Elasmobranch. In the former (Fig.
  145, A) it may be doubted if the girdle has passed beyond the basipterygial stage, and although a
  definite girdle is present in the latter genus (Fig. 250) its lateral halves retain their
  primitive distinctness. Existing Elasmobranchs, including the Holocephali, have a pectoral girdle
  in the form of a dorsally incomplete hoop of cartilage imbedded in the muscles of the body-wall,
  close behind the last branchial arch (Fig. 141). The upper or dorsal portion of each half is the
  scapula, and the ventral is the coracoid. Between these two portions of the girdle, and defining
  their limits, there are articular surfaces for the basal cartilages of the pectoral fin.</p>

  distinct girdle, formed by the median union of primitively distinct lateral rudiments, consisting
  of a simple transverse bar of cartilage, imbedded in the ventral abdominal wall, just in front of
  the cloacal aperture, and having articulated to each of its outer extremities the basal cartilage

  <p>Sometimes there is a rudiment of a dorsally-directed "iliac" process at each extremity of the
  girdle, but in no Fish do these processes ever acquire a dorsal connexion with the vertebral
  column. In the Holocephali the iliac processes are better developed than in any other Fishes, but
  ventrally the lateral halves of the girdle are united by ligament alone. In the Teleostomi
  important differences are observable in both girdles. The primary cartilaginous pectoral girdle
  now consists of distinct lateral halves which have no ventral connexion with each other. In
  addition, there is developed on the outer surface of each half a series of membrane bones, which
  form a secondary girdle (Fig. 143). From above downward the series includes a supraclavicle and a
  cleithrum (clavicle of Teleosts) which are always present, and to these may be added in the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page241"><span class="smaller">{241}</span></span>Crossopterygii and
  Chondrostei an infraclavicle or clavicle proper, while one or two "post-clavicles" may be present
  in relation with the hinder margin of the cleithrum. The infraclavicles, or in their absence the
  cleithra (<i>e.g.</i> Holostei and most Teleostei), usually meet in a median ventral symphysis, so
  that the secondary girdle tends to acquire the characteristic hoop-like arrangement of its parts
  which has been lost in the primary girdle. With the development of a bony secondary girdle, the
  primary girdle (scapula and coracoid) becomes much reduced, and, as a rule, does little more than
  connect the fins with the cleithra. The secondary girdle acquires a dorsal connexion with the
  skull on each side by means of the post-temporal bone, which is attached below to the
  supra-clavicle and above to the periotic capsule. In the Chondrostei and the Dipnoi the primary
  girdle retains its primitive cartilaginous condition, but in the Crossopterygii, Holostei, and in
  all Teleosts it is ossified as distinct scapulae and coracoids. To these may be added in some
  Teleosts a mesocoracoid formed by a separate ossification of the coracoid cartilage (Fig. 143).<a

  <p>With the possible exception of small paired or median cartilages inserted between the inner
  extremities of the basipterygia in <i>Polypterus</i> and a few other Teleostomi, the pelvic girdle
  is absent in all the existing members of this group, having either become completely suppressed,
  or remaining unseparated from the basipterygia of the pelvic fins.<a id="NtA_217"
  href="#Nt_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a> In the Dipnoi (Fig. 144) there is a true pelvic girdle which
  has some points of resemblance to that of certain of the caudate Amphibia. It is represented by a
  median, lozenge-shape, cartilaginous <span class="pagenum" id="page242"><span

  and on each side of this into a forwardly inclined prepubic process. The hinder part of the plate
  bears two short processes for the basal cartilages of the pelvic fins. There is no trace, however,
  of iliac processes.</p>

  <p><b>The Pectoral Fins.</b>&mdash;The skeleton of the pectoral fins exhibits remarkable
  structural variations in different Elasmobranchs. In the existing members of the group two large
  basal cartilages, the propterygium and the mesopterygium, are formed by the concentration and
  fusion of the proximal portions of certain of the preaxial radialia, and they, with the
  metapterygium, articulate with the pectoral girdle; hence the fin is tribasal as well as uniserial
  (Figs. 141 and 146, A, B). In striking contrast to all other Elasmobranchs the pectoral fin of
  <i>Cladoselache</i> (Fig. 145, A) is far more primitive than in any other Fish. Each fin is
  supported by a distal series of slender, more or less parallel, unjointed, cartilaginous radialia,
  and basally by a similar series of shorter, stouter, and less numerous cartilages, which
  apparently were imbedded in the body-wall, the entire fin skeleton presenting a striking
  resemblance to an isolated median fin in which the supporting radialia have concentrated by growth
  pressure, and their proximal portions have been reduced in number by partial fusion.<a

  <p>The broadly lobate pectoral fin of the existing Crossopterygii (Fig. 146, G) is uniserial,
  closely resembling that of the more typical Elasmobranchs.<a id="NtA_219"
  href="#Nt_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a> There are three basal elements, a propterygium, a
  mesopterygium, and a metapterygium, each of which supports a series of partially ossified
  radialia. Little is known of the endoskeletal elements of the broadly or acutely lobate fins of
  the fossil Crossopterygii, but it seems probable that their disposition was uniserial and
  abbreviate in obtusely lobate fins and biserial in acutely lobate fins. In the remaining
  Teleostomi (Actinopterygii) the endoskeletal elements become <span class="pagenum"
  id="page244"><span class="smaller">{244}</span></span>gradually reduced in number and importance,
  their place as fin-supports being usurped by the dermal fin-rays. In addition, more than three,
  usually several, basal elements articulate directly with the pectoral girdle, and hence the fins
  become multi-basal. In the Chondrostei and the Holostei a metapterygium is always recognisable,
  supporting several radialia along its preaxial border, as in <i>Acipenser</i> (Fig. 146, D) and
  <i>Amia</i> (Fig. 146, E), or only a single one, as in <i>Lepidosteus</i> (Fig. 146, F). The
  anterior part of the fin is supported by a variable number of cartilaginous or bony radialia,
  which, with the metapterygium, articulate with the limb-girdle. In Teleosts the process of
  reduction reaches its maximum. Usually there is but a single row of short, hour-glass-shaped
  ossicles, of which the postaxial one may represent a vestigial metapterygium, and sometimes there
  is also a distal row of small cartilages or ossicles, partially hidden in the cleft bases of the
  dermal fin-rays (Fig. 146, H). In all these Fishes the fin is a much reduced uniserial fin, in
  which more or fewer of the preaxial radialia have acquired a direct secondary connexion with the
  pectoral girdle. Of living Dipnoids <i>Neoceratodus</i> has a nearly typical biserial fin, but, as
  seems to be the case in all fins of this type at present known, there is a marked absence of
  symmetry in the number and disposition of the radialia on the two sides of the axis. There is also
  much individual variation. No two fins are precisely alike, and the radialia may sometimes divide.
  In the very acutely lobate fins of the remaining Dipnoids it is evident that great reduction has
  taken place. <i>Protopterus</i> has lost all trace of postaxial radialia, and in
  <i>Lepidosiren</i> even the preaxial have atrophied, leaving only the long jointed axis to
  represent the originally biserial fin.</p>

  <p><b>The Pelvic Fins.</b>&mdash;In the simplicity of their endoskeletal supports the pelvic fins
  of <i>Cladoselache</i> are the most primitive type of paired fins at present known (Fig. 145, B).
  In general structure they resemble the pectorals, but the radialia are fewer in number, less
  modified by concentration, and exhibit little, if any, trace of basal fusion. Add to such features
  as these the apparent absence of any trace of pelvic rudiments, or of basipterygia, and it will be
  obvious that the pelvic fins differ but little from the median fins of the same Fish except that
  they are paired. In <i>Pleuracanthus</i> the pelvic fins differ from the corresponding pectorals
  in being uniserial instead of biserial (Fig. 250). All other Elasmobranchs, including the
  Holocephali, have uniserial fins, which consist of a large metapterygium, supporting a preaxial
  fringe of segmented radialia. A propterygium is sometimes present, notably in some of the Skates
  and Rays, and, like the metapterygium, it is directly connected with the pelvic girdle.</p>

  <p>The skeleton of the pelvic fins of the Teleostomi is often extremely degenerate. It is perhaps
  best developed in the Chondrostei,<a id="NtA_220" href="#Nt_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a> where each
  fin is supported by numerous segmented radialia, more or fewer of which fuse towards the base of
  the fin, and those form a large and slightly ossified basipterygium (Fig. 148). In the living
  Crossopterygii, Holostei, and Teleostei, the pelvic fins are similar in essential structure, but
  are very degenerate. The basipterygium is usually well developed and is always bony (Fig. 149),
  and in many Teleosts it acquires so extensive a sutural connexion with its fellow that,
  physiologically, it supplies the place of a true pelvic girdle. At its distal end there may be a
  single row of small cartilaginous or bony nodules, representing vestigial radialia, as in the
  Crossopterygii, Holostei, and <span class="pagenum" id="page246"><span
  class="smaller">{246}</span></span>Teleostei, but even these may be absent, and the dermal
  fin-rays then articulate directly with the basipterygium. Little is known of the skeleton of the
  pelvic fins in the fossil Crossopterygii, but there is evidence of the existence of a higher grade
  of structure than in their surviving allies. In <i>Eusthenopteron</i>,<a id="NtA_221"
  href="#Nt_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a> for example, the fin is supported by an axis of at least three
  bony segments, with at least three ossified preaxial radialia; hence, it has obviously undergone
  less degeneration than in <i>Polypterus</i>, where the fin-skeleton is essentially Teleostean. In
  the Dipnoi the pelvic fins are similar to the corresponding pectoral fins, but individual
  variation is more marked and even the central axis may divide.<a id="NtA_222"
  href="#Nt_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a> In the males of all existing Elasmobranchs, including the
  Holocephali, certain of the more distally situated metapterygial radialia become modified to form

  group the anterior claspers are also provided with cartilaginous supports articulating with the
  pelvic girdle directly in front of the pelvic fins.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="smaller">THE DENTITION, ALIMENTARY
  CANAL, AND DIGESTIVE GLANDS</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">The alimentary canal is a muscular tube with an epithelial lining, formed for the
  reception and the digestion of the food. It begins with a mouth, and from thence it extends
  backwards through the coelom, finally communicating with the exterior either by a cloacal or by an
  anal orifice. The oral or buccal cavity into which the mouth leads is a stomodaeum, and is lined
  by inpushed epidermis, while the hinder portion of the cloaca and the anus are lined by a somewhat
  similar inpushing of the epidermis which forms the proctodaeum. The rest of the alimentary canal,
  consisting in succession of a pharynx, an oesophagus, a stomach, and an intestine, constitutes the
  mesenteron, and is lined by endoderm. Teeth are developed from the walls of the stomodaeum, and
  glands for the secretion of digestive fluids from the endoderm of the mesenteron.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Dentition.</b></p>

  <p>In the Lampreys among the Cyclostomata teeth are developed in the form of yellow conical
  structures on the inner surface of the buccal funnel, and on the extremity of the rasping "tongue"
  (Fig. 91, A). Each tooth consists of an axial papilla of the dermis, sometimes enclosing a
  pulp-cavity, and invested by the epidermis, and also by a stratified horny cone which forms the
  projecting hard part of the tooth. The dermal papilla with its ectodermal investment bears a
  superficial resemblance to the germ of a true calcified tooth, but no odontoblasts are formed, nor
  any calcic deposit, the laminated horny teeth being formed by the gradual conversion of the
  successive strata of the <span class="pagenum" id="page248"><span
  class="smaller">{248}</span></span>epidermic cells into horny layers.<a id="NtA_223"
  href="#Nt_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a> The old teeth are vertically replaced by new teeth developed
  beneath the functional teeth. With the exception of a median tooth above the oral aperture,
  <i>Myxine</i> and its allies have only lingual teeth. These are comb-like, and they are formed by
  the basal fusion of primitively distinct tooth-germs. The structure and development of the teeth
  of the Cyclostomes lend no support to the view that the teeth are degenerate calcified structures.
  With greater probability they represent a stage in the evolution of teeth and dermal spines, which
  has been succeeded by a later stage in which calcification superseded cornification as a method of
  hardening.</p>

  <p>True calcified teeth first make their appearance in Fishes, where they assume the form of
  modifications of exoskeletal structures.<a id="NtA_224" href="#Nt_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a> The
  teeth of Elasmobranchs are identical in essential structure, as well as in the manner of their
  development, with the ordinary dermal spines of the skin, and in the embryo the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page249"><span class="smaller">{249}</span></span>dermal spines form a
  continuous series with those which invest the jaws and eventually become teeth (Fig. 151). It is
  only later, when lips become apparent, that the continuity of the teeth and dermal spines is
  interrupted, and the two structures assume their distinctive characters.</p>

  <p>The tissues of which the teeth of Fishes are composed are (1) <i>dentine</i>, which is a
  non-vascular, calcified tissue, traversed by numerous radiating, branched, dentinal tubuli, into
  which extend protoplasmic prolongations from the cells (scleroblasts) by which the dentine is
  secreted. Dentine forms the greater part of the body of a tooth. (2) <i>vasodentine</i> and (3)
  <i>osteodentine</i> are modifications of ordinary dentine, the former containing blood-vessels
  ramifying in its substance but no dentinal tubules, and the latter more closely resembling bone.
  (4) <i>enamel</i>, an exceptionally dense, non-vascular, non-tubular tissue, which may or may not
  exhibit traces of the prismatic structure so characteristic of this tissue in the higher
  Vertebrates, forms the outer investment of the teeth.</p>

  <p>As regards their fixation, the more primitive forms of teeth, such as those of Elasmobranchs,
  are simply embedded in the gums, and are only connected with the jaws by fibrous tissue; but in
  some of the older fossil Sharks the fixation of the teeth is effected by the mutual articulation
  of the basal plates of the teeth with one another. The Chondrostean <i>Polyodon</i>, so <span
  class="pagenum" id="page250"><span class="smaller">{250}</span></span>shark-like in many other
  respects, also has teeth implanted basally in the gums, and quite free from any special connexion
  with the jaw-bones. In some Teleosts with movable teeth, the latter are merely attached to the
  jaws by fibrous, and often elastic, ligaments, as in the Pike (<i>Esox</i>) and the Angler-Fish
  (<i>Lophius</i>). As a rule, however, the teeth are directly ankylosed to the bones developed in
  relation with the jaws. Very rarely, as, for example, in some Characinidae, are the teeth
  implanted in sockets.</p>

  <p>Nearly all Fishes are polyphyodont, that is, the old teeth are constantly replaced by new teeth
  as fast as they become worn down or fall out. In the Sharks and Dog-Fishes, for example, where the
  teeth are arranged in rows parallel to the axis of each jaw, the functional teeth along the upper
  edge of the jaw are usually erect, while those in the rows more internally situated point inwards
  towards the oral cavity; and behind these again there are rows of developing teeth in different
  stages of growth, and partially hidden beneath a projecting fold of the oral mucous membrane (Fig.
  152). As the teeth in use become lost they are successively replaced by the inner rows, which,
  with the mucous membrane in which they are embedded, move forwards to the edge of the jaw, where
  they become erect and functional. The teeth of the Holocephali and of the Dipnoi are not shed, but
  the loss which they sustain through wear and tear is made good by persistent growth at their
  bases. In the Teleostomi the succession is less regular, new teeth being formed between or at the
  bases of the old teeth. In the case of socketed teeth the succession is usually vertical, the new
  teeth being formed at the sides of the old ones; and by the absorption of the bases of the latter,
  the former come to lie directly below them, and eventually they occupy the same sockets.</p>

  <p>As might be expected from the remarkable diversity in the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page251"><span class="smaller">{251}</span></span>habits and in the food of different Fishes,
  the teeth exhibit an equally striking diversity in form, size, and structure. The most primitive
  type of tooth resembles an ordinary dermal spine, and is little more than a simple pointed cone. A
  few Elasmobranchs and many Teleostomi possess teeth of this kind. By the flattening of the cone
  parallel to the axis of the jaw, the tooth becomes triangular, and then the margins may either
  remain smooth and trenchant, or they may become complicated by the formation of marginal
  serrations or of accessory basal cusps, and by such modifications the characteristic teeth of most
  Elasmobranchs are formed. The simple cone may also be modified to form crushing teeth&mdash;short,
  blunt, more or less hemispherical teeth&mdash;or even transformed into a mosaic of hexagonal
  plates, as in the Myliobatidae amongst Elasmobranchs. Massive, flattened, scroll-like crushing
  teeth are also formed by the fusion of adjacent teeth, or of several successional teeth, and of
  such composite teeth we have examples in the Heterodontidae and in the Palaeozoic Cochliodontidae.
  By a somewhat similar process of concrescence the anomalous composite teeth of such Teleosts as
  the Diodons and Tetrodons, and of the Parrot-Fish (<i>Scarus</i>), have been evolved. The singular
  dental structures of the Holocephali are probably composite teeth, and it is certain that the
  highly characteristic teeth of the Dipnoi have resulted from the basal fusion of primitively
  distinct simple conical denticles. The dentition is often heterodont. In <i>Heterodontus</i>
  (<i>Cestracion</i>), for example, the anterior teeth in each jaw are pointed and prehensile, while
  the hinder ones are scroll-like and crushing. Prehensile and crushing molar-like teeth are also
  present in such Teleosts as many of the Sparidae, and in the Wolf-Fish (<i>Anarrhichas</i>). The
  existence of sexual differences in the dentition is illustrated in the Skates and Rays
  (<i>Raia</i>), where teeth which are simple and pointed in the male become flattened and
  plate-like in the female. A few Teleosts, like the Syngnathidae, Cyprinidae, and some Siluridae,
  are entirely devoid of jaw-teeth.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In addition to jaw-teeth, many Teleosts possess pharyngeal or gill-teeth, developed
  in connexion with the inner margins of the branchial arches, to which they are usually firmly
  ankylosed (Figs. 352, 412 and 413). As a rule "the pharyngeal dentition is inversely proportional
  to the extent of tooth development <span class="pagenum" id="page252"><span
  class="smaller">{252}</span></span>on the jaws."<a id="NtA_225"
  href="#Nt_225"><sup>[225]</sup></a> Pharyngeal teeth differ greatly in size and structure in
  different Teleosts, and, like the jaw-teeth, they are capable of replacement by vertical
  succession. The teeth are sometimes restricted to the inferior pharyngeal bones (cerato-branchials
  of the last branchial arch), and then, as in the Carp (<i>Cyprinus</i>), they may bite against a
  callous pad on the under surface of the basioccipital bone; or, as in some of the Wrasses
  (<i>Labrus</i>), the inferior teeth are opposed to superior teeth on the upper pharyngeal bones
  (pharyngo-branchials of more or fewer of the branchial arches). When pharyngeal teeth are present
  it is probable that they are the principal masticatory organs, the jaw-teeth being used for
  seizing or holding the prey.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Alimentary Canal.</b></p>

  <p>A protrusible tongue is never developed in Fishes. A rudiment of that organ is present in the
  Elasmobranchs (Fig. 153) and Dipnoi, and also in the Crossopterygii, and usually consists of an
  elevated area of mucous membrane provided with free lateral edges and a forwardly projecting apex;
  it is supported by the basi-hyal element of the hyoid arch. In the Crossopterygii (e.g.
  <i>Polypterus</i>) the tongue contains muscle fibres, and in the Dipnoi, where the organ is better
  developed than in any other Fishes, special lingual muscles are present.</p>

  <p>The pharynx succeeds the oral cavity, and is perforated on each side by the branchial clefts
  (Figs. 153, 154). The rest of the alimentary canal differs considerably in various Fishes in the
  degree of distinctness of its several regions, and in the extent to which it is convoluted. As a
  rule the pharynx is followed in succession by an oesophagus, a stomach, and an intestine (Fig.
  153), the latter terminating in a portion usually termed the "rectum." The boundaries of these
  regions are not always very obvious, but are indicated by variations in calibre, by changes in the
  character of the lining epithelium, by special valves or sphincter muscles, or by the entrance of
  the ducts of certain glands like the pancreas and liver.</p>

  <p>The oesophagus is occasionally separated from the stomach by a slight constriction, but more
  frequently the replacement of the squamous epithelium of the oesophagus by the columnar epithelium
  of the stomach and the appearance of gastric glands in the wall of the latter cavity afford the
  only distinction between the two regions. The <span class="pagenum" id="page254"><span
  class="smaller">{254}</span></span>commencement of the intestine is usually indicated by a pyloric
  "valve" (Fig. 155, A, B), in the form of a ring-like, inwardly projecting thickening of the
  circularly-disposed muscle fibres of the terminal extremity of the stomach, and usually also by
  the entrance of the distinct or united ducts of the liver and pancreas; sometimes, as in certain
  Elasmobranchs and in the Dipnoi, by a special dilatation or "Bursa Entiana" (Fig. 155, A). The
  rectum, or terminal portion of the intestine, is distinguished from the rest of the gut by its
  straight course to the cloacal aperture or the anus, and sometimes by an increase in calibre. In
  <i>Box vulgaris</i> and a few other Teleosts<a id="NtA_226" href="#Nt_226"><sup>[226]</sup></a> a
  caecal diverticulum indicates the commencement of the rectum, while in a few cases the pre-rectal
  portion of the intestine communicates with the enlarged rectal segment by a much constricted
  valvular orifice which is suggestive of the ileo-colic valve of the higher Vertebrates,<a
  id="NtA_227" href="#Nt_227"><sup>[227]</sup></a> as in the Teleosts <i>Amiurus catus</i>,<a
  id="NtA_228" href="#Nt_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a> <i>Trigla gurnardus</i>, and <i>Cyclopterus
  lumpus</i>.</p>

  <p>The relation of the regional divisions of the intestine in Fishes to those of other Vertebrates
  are somewhat difficult to determine. If we may regard the "rectal" gland of Elasmobranchs and the
  intestinal caecum of certain Teleosts as homologous with each other, and with the caecum coli of
  the higher Vertebrates, then it would seem that by far the greater part of the intestine of
  Fishes, including that portion in which a spiral valve may be developed, is homologous with the
  pre-caecal segment of the gut or small intestine in other Vertebrates, and that the post-caecal
  section, or large intestine, of the latter is represented in Fishes only by that relatively short
  portion of the gut which lies posterior to the rectal gland or its homologue in Teleosts, the
  equivalent of the colon of Mammalia being, as in Amphibia, Reptiles, and Birds, practically
  undifferentiated.<a id="NtA_229" href="#Nt_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the Cyclostomata the alimentary canal retains much of its primitive simplicity. It pursues a
  straight course from mouth to anus, and the usual regions are very obscurely indicated. The same
  remarks apply also to the Holocephali and a few Teleosts, although in these Fishes the limits of
  the different regions are somewhat more clearly defined. In the Dipnoi (Fig. 155, A), a contracted
  sigmoid curve between the somewhat dilated stomach and the spacious intestine is the only
  departure from the straight course of the preceding groups.</p>

  <p>In the remaining Fishes the degree of convolution varies within rather wide limits. The
  oesophagus is usually straight and wide, but in <i>Lutodeira</i>, among Teleosts, it is long and
  even convoluted, and in the Plectognath Teleosts it gives off a large sac-like outgrowth
  ("air-sac"), which extends anteriorly as far as the head, and posteriorly to the beginning of the
  tail, and communicates with the oesophagus by two apertures. The stomach may be <span class="sans
  fwb">U</span>-shaped with the concavity directed forwards, and consisting of a right limb passing
  backwards from the oesophagus, and a left limb curving forwards to its junction with the intestine
  (Fig. 153). In such instances as these the stomach and the adjacent section of the intestine
  describe a characteristic siphonal curve. In certain other Fishes (Fig. 160), the oesophageal
  portion of the stomach terminates behind in a tubular or sac-like dilatation at some distance
  posterior to the laterally situated pylorus, which indicates the origin of the intestine. The
  intestine is straight, or nearly so, in Elasmobranchs, Crossopterygii, and Dipnoi, and also in a
  few Teleosts; but sometimes, and very generally in Teleosts, it is more or less convoluted,
  notably in some of the Mugilidae, and in the Loricariidae, where, as in <i>Plecostomus</i>, it is
  disposed in numerous spiral coils like a watch-spring. The terminal portion of the intestine or
  rectum either opens into a cloaca, which also receives the urinary and genital ducts, as in
  Elasmobranchs (Fig. 153), and Dipnoi (Fig. 155, A), or opens externally by an anus, situated in
  front of the separate or united urinogenital ducts, as is the case with all the remaining groups
  of Fishes (Fig. 154). The cloacal aperture is invariably situated near the junction of the caudal
  and trunk regions, and as a rule is median in position, rarely, as in the Dipnoi, displaced to the
  right or left of the middle line; but the anus differs greatly in position, sometimes retaining
  its primitive position at the hinder end of the trunk, as in the Holocephali, Chondrostei,
  Crossopterygii, Holostei, and many Teleosts, or occupying almost any position between that point
  and, as in the "Electric Eels" (Gymnotidae), the ventral surface of the throat (Fig. 351.)</p>

  <p>The whole length of the alimentary canal from the oesophagus to the rectum is invested
  externally by the visceral layer of the peritoneum (Fig. 156), which histologically consists of a
  stratum of connective tissue, supporting on its free surface an epithelial stratum (coelomic
  epithelium). Primarily, the investing peritoneum is continued both dorsally and ventrally into
  bilaminar suspensory folds, the dorsal and ventral mesenteries (<i>d.ms</i>, <i>v.ms</i>), which
  extend to the mid-dorsal or mid-ventral line of the abdominal cavity. The two layers then separate
  and become continuous with the parietal layer of the peritoneum lining the whole of the inner
  surface of the body-wall. Embryologically, the two mesenteries owe their formation to the fusion
  above and below the mesenteron of the contiguous walls of two laterally situated and primitively
  distinct coelomic cavities. The dorsal mesentery in the adult is occasionally complete, as in the
  Myxinoid Cyclostomata and in the Elasmobranch <i>Hypnos subnigrum</i>,<a id="NtA_230"
  href="#Nt_230"><sup>[230]</sup></a> and also in some Dipnoi and in a few Teleosts, but much more
  frequently it is reduced by absorption to anterior and posterior remnants, or to a series of
  isolated bands, or even, as in the Lamprey (<i>Petromyzon</i>), to a few filaments accompanying
  the intestinal blood-vessels. The ventral mesentery, on the contrary, is rarely present, and if
  present is never complete. In <i>Lepidosteus</i><a id="NtA_231"
  href="#Nt_231"><sup>[231]</sup></a> a ventral mesentery <span class="pagenum" id="page259"><span

  the greater part of the length of the intestine, although in the former Dipnoid its continuity is
  interrupted by one or two vacuities, and in the latter the mesentery is incomplete posteriorly. A
  ventral mesentery is also present in the intestinal region of some of the Muraenidae among

  <p>Internal to its peritoneal investment the wall of the alimentary canal consists in succession
  from without inwards of (1), a <span class="pagenum" id="page260"><span
  class="smaller">{260}</span></span>muscular coat, (2) the submucosa, and (3) an epithelial stratum
  or mucous membrane, the first two of these layers, with the addition of the peritoneum, being
  derivatives of the inner or splanchnic portion of the embryonic mesoblast.<a id="NtA_235"
  href="#Nt_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Excluding the oesophagus, where the muscular coat is mainly composed of striated fibres, the
  musculature of the alimentary canal usually consists solely of non-striated, spindle-shaped fibres
  disposed in two layers, an external stratum of longitudinally arranged fibres, and an inner
  stratum of circularly disposed fibres (Fig. 157), with the addition, in the stomach, of an oblique
  layer between the two. In the oesophagus the reverse arrangement may exist, the circular layer
  being external and the longitudinal internal. The muscular coat varies considerably in thickness
  in different regions and in different Fishes, and in the Cyclostomata, the Holocephali, some
  Teleosts, and the Dipnoi may be very feebly developed, or even entirely absent, as in the
  intestine of the Hag-Fish (<i>Myxine</i>). In the Gillaroo Trout (<i>Salmo stomachicus</i>),<a
  id="NtA_236" href="#Nt_236"><sup>[236]</sup></a> on the contrary, the distal section of the
  siphonal stomach has its musculature unusually thickened, so as to form an incipient gizzard for
  the crushing of the shells of the freshwater Molluscs on which the Fish feeds. In some of the
  Mullets (Mugilidae),<a id="NtA_237" href="#Nt_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a> a true gizzard is
  developed by the enormous thickening of the muscular coat of the caecal stomach, the cavity of
  which, in consequence, is reduced to a mere vertical fissure, and is lined by an exceptionally
  thick, horny epithelium.</p>

  <p>There are a few exceptions to the rule that the muscular fibres are of the non-striated
  variety. Thus in some Teleosts, as in the Tench (<i>Tinca vulgaris</i>), striated fibres are
  continued from the oesophagus into the walls of the stomach and intestine, and there form an outer
  longitudinal and an inner circular layer, situated externally to the corresponding layers of the
  non-striated stratum. <span class="pagenum" id="page261"><span
  class="smaller">{261}</span></span>In the Siluroid, <i>Amiurus</i>, the striated fibres of the
  outer circular layer of the oesophagus are continued, although but sparsely, into the inner
  circular layer of the stomach.</p>

  <p>The submucosa (Fig. 157) lies between the muscular layer externally and the epithelial lining
  internally, and is characteristically developed in the stomach, and even more so in the intestine.
  Histologically, it consists of a framework of connective tissue, enclosing in its meshes masses of
  leucocytes (lymphoid tissue), some of which are amoeboid and migratory, and may even be found
  between the cells of the intestinal epithelium (including in some instances the cloacal
  epithelium), probably actively participating in the transmission of food material from the
  alimentary canal to the lymphatics and blood-vessels; while other and somewhat similar, but
  larger, leucocytes (phagocytes), are concerned with the elimination of waste substances or noxious
  micro-organisms. In addition to the diffused lymphoid tissue of the submucosa, special rounded or
  oval, and sometimes encapsuled, masses of this tissue (lymph follicles) are common in the
  intestinal wall (Fig. 157) of <i>Acipenser</i>, the Dipnoi and some Elasmobranchs, and are perhaps
  the only representatives in Fishes of the solitary follicles or "Peyer's patches" of the higher
  Vertebrates. A mass of lymphoid tissue exists in the axis of the spiral valve of <i>Acipenser</i>,
  which has been compared with a similarly situated structure in <i>Lepidosiren</i>.<a id="NtA_238"
  href="#Nt_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a> In some Elasmobranchs a large lymphoid organ is imbedded in
  the submucosa of the oesophageal wall, while a local thickening of the tissue is met with in the
  pyloric sphincter. <i>Protopterus</i> is remarkable among Vertebrates for the extraordinary
  development of lymphoid tissue,<a id="NtA_239" href="#Nt_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a> which, apart
  from its distribution in the submucosa, is abundantly present between the longitudinal and
  circular muscle layers, and the peritoneal and muscular coats of the intestine.</p>

  <p>In addition to the lymphoid tissue the submucosa contains non-striated muscle cells and
  plexuses of capillary blood-vessels, which in certain Loaches (e.g. <i>Misgurnus</i>), where
  intestinal respiration occurs, extend between the cells of the intestinal epithelium. A network of
  lymphatic spaces or vessels surrounds the blood-vessels. In some Elasmobranchs the small arteries
  of the submucosa of the stomach are provided with singular sphincter muscles, which <span
  class="pagenum" id="page262"><span class="smaller">{262}</span></span>occasionally encircle both
  the artery and the corresponding vein.<a id="NtA_240" href="#Nt_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The lining epithelium differs considerably in character in different portions of the alimentary
  canal. The epithelium of the mouth, pharynx, and anterior section of the oesophagus is often
  squamous and is succeeded in the hinder part of the oesophagus, and in the stomach and intestine,
  by a columnar epithelium. As a rule the epithelium of the rectum is also columnar, but in
  Elasmobranchs it may become squamous. Goblet cells are of very frequent occurrence throughout the
  whole length of the alimentary canal, from the mouth to the rectum inclusive, interspersed between
  the superficial epithelial cells; in the same position in the intestine migratory leucocytes have
  been found. The primitive ciliation of the Vertebrate alimentary canal is retained to a greater or
  less extent in many Fishes, and is sometimes, but not always, associated with a feeble development
  of the musculature. In the larval form of <i>Petromyzon</i> (<i>Ammocoetes</i>), the whole canal
  is ciliated except the pharynx and rectum; but in the adult ciliation is retained only in places
  which gradually become fewer as the rectum is approached. In the Myxinoids, however, cilia are
  said to be absent.</p>

  <p>In the Dipnoi (e.g. <i>Protopterus</i>) the epithelium of the stomach and intestine is largely
  ciliated, but in Elasmobranchs, ciliation is usually restricted to the posterior portion of the
  oesophagus and the edge of the spiral valve. Among the more generalised Teleostomi (e.g.
  <i>Acipenser</i>, <i>Lepidosteus</i>, <i>Amia</i>), the oesophagus, stomach, and intestine may be
  ciliated, but to an extent which varies in different genera. The pyloric appendages, when present,
  are also more or less extensively ciliated. In Teleosts, however, the recorded instances of
  ciliation are relatively rare. Nevertheless, ciliated epithelium has been found in the intestine
  of a few species (e.g. <i>Rhombus aculeatus</i> and <i>Syngnathus acus</i>), and also in the
  pyloric appendages; in the stomach (e.g. <i>Perca</i> and <i>Esox</i>), and even in the oesophagus
  (e.g. <i>Perca</i>).</p>

  <p>The mucous membrane, including the submucosa, is frequently developed into variously arranged
  ingrowths projecting into the lumen of the alimentary canal; these are generally of the nature of
  longitudinal or transverse ridges, or a combination of the two, giving rise to retiform
  structures. The simple longitudinal <span class="pagenum" id="page263"><span
  class="smaller">{263}</span></span>folds, which are sometimes found in the oesophagus, stomach,
  and rectum, often disappear on distension, and probably merely provide for the enlargement of
  these cavities during the deglutition of relatively large prey, or for the accumulation of faeces.
  On the other hand, the permanent and often complicated folds of the intestinal mucous membrane are
  probably related to an increase in the secretive or absorptive area of this portion of the
  alimentary canal. In the stomach the mucous membrane is usually smooth, rarely, as in the
  "Electric Eel" (<i>Gymnotus</i>), reticulate. In the intestine the folds assume a highly
  characteristic and often complicated disposition.<a id="NtA_241"
  href="#Nt_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a> In the Cyclostomata the folds are simple and longitudinally
  arranged. In Elasmobranchs (Fig. 158, A), obliquely transverse folds are present in addition, and,
  uniting with the longitudinal ridges, bound linear depressions.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In various Teleostomi (Fig. 158, B, C, D), the union of the two series of folds becomes more or
  less retiform, and the network of intersecting ridges bounds a series of deep tubular crypts which
  appear to penetrate to a considerable distance into the intestinal wall, and possibly foreshadow
  the characteristic Lieberk&uuml;hn's glands of Mammalia. Crypts may also be found in the stomach, where
  they receive the apertures of the gastric glands, as in <i>Amiurus</i>, but more usually they are
  restricted to the intestine. In the Dipnoi (e.g. <i>Protopterus</i>) the mucous membrane of the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page264"><span class="smaller">{264}</span></span>stomach,
  and&mdash;excluding the Bursa Entiana where a number of oblique folds are present&mdash;of the
  intestine also, is, on the contrary, perfectly smooth.</p>

  <p>In addition to transverse and longitudinal folds the mucous membrane of the various sections of
  the alimentary canal is often developed into outgrowths which are more or less linear.<a
  id="NtA_242" href="#Nt_242"><sup>[242]</sup></a> In the oesophagus these may be papilliform, as in
  <i>Box</i> and <i>Caesio</i>; obtuse in <i>Acipenser</i>, hard and almost spine-like in species of
  <i>Rhombus</i>; or in the form of pyramidal retroverted processes with jagged or fringed edges, as
  in the Spiny Dog-Fish (<i>Acanthias vulgaris</i>). In the Basking Shark (<i>Selache</i>) similar
  processes are present, which, near the stomach, become unusually long and branched, so that the
  entrance to that cavity is surrounded by a series of backwardly-directed arborescent tufts.
  Peculiar papillose or tag-like processes of the mucous membrane are frequently present on the
  spiral valve of Elasmobranchs, in the intestine of such Teleosts as <i>Balistes</i>, <i>Mugil</i>
  and some Pleuronectidae, and also in the rectum of <i>Rhombus maximus</i>.</p>

  <p>Of all the outgrowths from the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal the so-called "spiral
  valve" of the Cyclostomata, Elasmobranchs, Holocephali, Chondrostei, Crossopterygii, Amiidae,
  Lepidosteidae and Dipnoi is the most characteristic. The first appearance of this structure was
  probably in the form of a straight longitudinal fold or ridge projecting into the cavity of the
  intestine, similar, perhaps, to the typhlosole of many Invertebrata. This primitive condition is
  not retained in any existing Fishes, although it may be closely approached in the larval
  Cyclostome (<i>Ammocoetes</i>), and is perhaps also indicated in the straight anterior portion of
  the spiral valve of <i>Polypterus</i>. Absent altogether in the Myxinoids, the valve is
  represented in its simplest condition, as in certain other Cyclostomata (e.g. <i>Petromyzon</i>),
  by a ridge of mucous membrane which commences anteriorly on the dorsal side, and, after describing
  a partial spiral as it passes backwards, terminates posteriorly on the ventral side, the width of
  the valve not exceeding half the diameter of the intestine. This simple type of valve is repeated
  in embryo Elasmobranchs, but in the adults of these Fishes the valve becomes much more
  complicated, and exhibits a wide range of structural variation. The increased complexity of the
  valve <span class="pagenum" id="page265"><span class="smaller">{265}</span></span>seems to depend
  on several factors, the effect of which, in different Elasmobranchs, is best studied in a series
  of valves of progressively higher differentiation.<a id="NtA_243"
  href="#Nt_243"><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In a hypothetical simple type of valve, easily derivable from the more primitive type of
  <i>Petromyzon</i>, it may be conceived that, while not exceeding in width the semi-diameter of the
  intestine, the valve becomes disposed in several complete and more or less closely approximated
  spiral turns, the free edge of the valve being on the same level as its attached margin, and
  leaving an open axial canal along the centre of the gut. The nearest approach to this hypothetical
  type, which has been compared, not inaptly, to <i>un escalier tournant sans noyau</i>, is perhaps
  to be found in the Thresher-Shark (<i>Alopecias vulpes</i>).</p>

  <p>The structure of the more complicated spiral valves of other Elasmobranchs are well illustrated
  within the limits of the single genus <i>Raia</i>.</p>

  <p>In one specimen of <i>Raia</i> sp. (Fig. 159, A) the last four coils of the valve are similar
  to those of the hypothetical type, but the more anterior ones, owing to the greater width of the
  valve, which here exceeds the semi-diameter of the intestine, have their free margins deflected
  downwards, while that portion of the valve which forms the first half turn is coiled inwards upon
  itself, so as to form a hollow cone, open dorsally, and having its apex directed forwards. In
  other examples a further modification is introduced by the increasing width of the valve, which
  now, throughout its whole length, equals the semi-diameter of the intestine; and by the formation
  of an axial columella by the thickened free edge of the valve, which is traversed by a central
  band of unstriped muscle, as well as by the intra-intestinal artery and vein, and takes the place
  of the central canal of the preceding types. The valve is, however, still regular, and its free
  margin remains on the same level as the corresponding portion of the attached edge. In other
  specimens, again, additional complications are introduced by a still further increase in the width
  of the valve, which now exceeds, often considerably, the semi-diameter of the intestine, and the
  consequent deflection of the free edge of the valve either forwards or backwards (C and D). As
  shown in C the valve, in consequence of the backward deflection of its free margin, presents the
  appearance of a nest of <span class="pagenum" id="page266"><span
  class="smaller">{266}</span></span>imperfect truncated cones with their apices directed backwards,
  the successive cones adhering so closely to one another that they combine to form a central
  conical chamber with a spirally disposed cavity winding round it. In D, on the contrary, the free
  edge of the valve is deflected forwards, so that, as in C, a nest of cones is formed, but the
  apices of the successive cones are directed forwards instead of backwards. Notwithstanding these
  variations in the structure of the valve as a whole, the first coil or half coil nearly always
  resembles that described in A.</p>

  <p>It is obvious that the structure of the valve varies considerably within the limits of the
  genus, and it may be added that various intermediate types of structure occur between A and B,
  <span class="pagenum" id="page267"><span class="smaller">{267}</span></span>A and C, and A and D.
  The individual variations are perhaps even more remarkable, and appear to be quite independent of
  age and sex. By way of example it may be mentioned that valves approximating to one or other of
  those represented by C and D occur in different individuals of <i>Raia maculata</i> of the same
  sex and similar in size, even in young specimens not more than three inches in length.</p>

  <p>As regards other Elasmobranchs, the common Dog-Fish (<i>Scyllium canicula</i>)<a id="NtA_244"
  href="#Nt_244"><sup>[244]</sup></a> has a well-developed spiral valve disposed in twelve coils,
  which structurally represents a more highly developed example of the type D. The existence of
  considerable individual variation is nevertheless indicated by the fact that in one specimen
  examined the valve was intermediate between C and D, five of the eight cones projecting forwards
  and three backwards. In a specimen of <i>Notidanus</i> sp.<a id="NtA_245"
  href="#Nt_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a> there were as many as twenty coils, which in disposition were
  intermediate between B and C, approximating, however, more nearly to B. In a specimen of the Port
  Jackson Shark (<i>Heterodontus</i>)<a id="NtA_246" href="#Nt_246"><sup>[246]</sup></a> the valve
  had eight coils, and in structure was also intermediate between B and C, but approached more
  nearly to C. Some of the Hammer-headed Sharks (e.g. <i>Sphyrna malleus</i>)<a id="NtA_247"
  href="#Nt_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a> possess a type of spiral valve which differs considerably from
  any of those hitherto described, and is termed a "scroll" valve (Fig. 159, E). The attached edge
  of the valve pursues a straight longitudinal course, or at any rate only describes a half turn and
  back again in passing from the pyloric to the cloacal extremity of the gut. In the middle of its
  course the width of the valve is about equal to two-thirds of its length, but towards either
  extremity it gradually diminishes until the free and attached margins meet. The valve thus
  constituted is rolled upon itself from left to right, the successive coils being comparable to a
  series of cylinders placed one inside the other, and becoming gradually larger both in length and
  diameter from within outwards. A similar valve is present in some of the Carchariidae.</p>

  <p>In the Holocephali (e.g. <i>Chimaera monstrosa</i>)<a id="NtA_248"
  href="#Nt_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a> the valve describes only three and a half coils, and is
  further remarkable in that the attached margin, for a considerable portion of its <span
  class="pagenum" id="page268"><span class="smaller">{268}</span></span>extent, does not form a
  regular spiral but describes only a slightly sinuous course. Posteriorly, the valve is more
  normal, and consists of about two cones with their apices directed forwards.</p>

  <p>In the Dipnoi the spiral valve is well developed, and in <i>Neoceratodus</i><a id="NtA_249"
  href="#Nt_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a> describes nine coils, and in <i>Protopterus</i><a id="NtA_250"
  href="#Nt_250"><sup>[250]</sup></a> six or seven. The structure of the valve in the latter Dipnoid
  resembles that of <i>Scyllium canicula</i>, except for the smaller number of cones.</p>

  <p>In the more generalised Teleostomi the valve is best developed in the Sturgeon
  (<i>Acipenser</i>) and in <i>Polypterus</i>. In the former<a id="NtA_251"
  href="#Nt_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a> the valve is restricted to the posterior half of the total
  length of the intestine, often extending to within an inch of the anal aperture, and describing in
  its backward course about seven or eight coils. The width of the valve is about equal to the
  semi-diameter of the intestine, and the thickened free margin forms a well-marked axial columella,
  round which the cavity of the gut winds, as in the type B, except that the spiral is a more open
  one. In <i>Polypterus</i> the valve begins close to the solitary pyloric caecum, and for some
  distance pursues a straight longitudinal course, but eventually forms a few spiral coils, ceasing,
  however, at a considerable distance from the anus. The evidence afforded by petrified faeces or
  "coprolites" proves that certain extinct Crossopterygii (e.g. <i>Macropoma</i>,
  <i>Megalichthys</i>), like their living representative, <i>Polypterus</i>, possessed a spiral
  valve.<a id="NtA_252" href="#Nt_252"><sup>[252]</sup></a> In <i>Amia</i> and <i>Lepidosteus</i><a
  id="NtA_253" href="#Nt_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a> the valve is almost vestigial, being restricted
  to the terminal portion of the intestine, and is somewhat variable as to the precise number of its
  coils. In <i>Amia</i> there are nearly four coils, extending over 3 cm., that is less than a tenth
  of the total length of the intestine, but in some specimens the coils do not exceed two and a half
  or three in number. <i>Lepidosteus</i><a id="NtA_254" href="#Nt_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a> has a
  still shorter valve which, in specimens of 7-10 cm. in length, may not consist of more than three
  and a half coils, and in much larger specimens may be reduced to less than two coils, a variation
  which suggests that a reduction takes place in the number of coils as the fish increases in age
  and size. The structure of the valve in the three last-mentioned genera resembles that described
  in <i>Acipenser</i>, and in none of them does <span class="pagenum" id="page269"><span
  class="smaller">{269}</span></span>the width of the valve so far exceed the semi-diameter of the
  intestine as, by forward or backward deflection, to give rise to the highly characteristic cones
  of Elasmobranchs and Dipnoi.</p>

  <p>In the more specialised Teleostomi (Teleostei) the spiral valve is wholly wanting, except
  perhaps as a vestigial structure in certain Clupeoids, as, for example, <i>Chirocentrus</i>,<a
  id="NtA_255" href="#Nt_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a> and possibly also in some Salmonidae.<a
  id="NtA_256" href="#Nt_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a></p>

  <p>From what has been said as to the structure of the spiral valve in the different groups of
  Fishes, it may be concluded that the valve most nearly retains its primitive condition in the
  Cyclostomata; attains its maximum development in the Elasmobranchs, especially in the Notidanidae,
  and shows no indication of degeneration in the Dipnoi. In the Holocephali and the lower
  Teleostomi, on the other hand, the valve exhibits various stages of retrogressive modification,
  and in the Teleosts is either absent altogether or persists only as a vestigial structure in a
  very few species.</p>

  <p>From a physiological point of view the object of the spiral valve is to increase the absorptive
  inner surface of the intestine,<a id="NtA_257" href="#Nt_257"><sup>[257]</sup></a> but, from what
  has been said as to the structural variability of the valve, it is obvious that its efficacy from
  a functional standpoint must be equally variable. The value of the valve as an absorptive
  mechanism necessarily depends on the area of absorption-surface which it provides, as well as on
  the degree of resistance which it offers to the passage of food material along the cavity of the
  intestine. These factors will in turn depend on the number of coils, on the width of the valve,
  and on the extent to which its free margin is deflected in forming the series of cones, but these
  again are precisely the structural features which are most liable to variation. The total
  absorption area in the four types of valve characteristic of the genus <i>Raia</i> has been
  calculated, and may be expressed in square centimetres as follows:&mdash;A, 136.64; B, 143.82; C,
  254.3; and D, 276.7.<a id="NtA_258" href="#Nt_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a> Hence as regards mere
  absorption area a spiral valve of the type D has twice the extent of a valve of the type A, and
  if, in addition, account be taken of the retardation of the food due to the increased obstruction
  offered by the columella and cones in D, it is clear that the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page270"><span class="smaller">{270}</span></span>difference in physiological value between
  the two types must be far more considerable than is indicated by a comparison of their relative
  superficial areas alone.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The evolution of the spiral valve was probably due to the necessity of increasing
  the absorptive area of an almost straight unconvoluted intestine, a result which in other animals
  is often obtained by an increase in the length and concurrent convolution of the intestine itself.
  Any attempt to correlate the variations in the degree of perfection or imperfection of the valve
  considered as an absorptive mechanism with any special variations in the nature or quality of the
  food is, however, a very difficult problem, and a satisfactory explanation has yet to be found.
  The difficulty, moreover, is increased by the fact that the majority of Fishes with a spiral valve
  are mainly carnivorous; the Elasmobranchs, in which this structure is at the same time most highly
  developed and most variable, exclusively so. On the other hand, the term "carnivorous" covers a
  multiplicity of minor differences in the nature and relative digestibility of different forms of
  animal food, and it is quite possible that it is with differences of this kind that the specific
  or individual variations in the development of the spiral valve are associated. The absence of the
  valve in the variously nourished Teleosts, save perhaps as a vestige in one or two, is also
  difficult to account for, although it is not improbable that compensating structural modifications
  exist in this group. As a rule, the intestine is much more convoluted in these Fishes, but to an
  extent which varies greatly in different species, while the characteristic pyloric caeca and the
  spiral valve appear to a certain extent to be developed in inverse proportion to one another.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>The Glands.</b></p>

  <p>The glands associated with the alimentary canal in different Fishes are (1) the gastric glands,
  (2) the liver, (3) the pancreas, (4) the pyloric appendages, and (5) the "rectal" gland.</p>

  <p>Oral salivary glands are wanting in all Fishes, the only secretory structures in the mouth
  being numerous mucus-secreting goblet cells, which here, as elsewhere throughout the alimentary
  canal, are intermixed with the ordinary epithelial cells.</p>

  <p><b>The Gastric Glands.</b>&mdash;The Cyclostomata and Dipnoi do not possess any specially
  differentiated gastric glands, and it is <span class="pagenum" id="page271"><span
  class="smaller">{271}</span></span>probable that in these Fishes the secretion of the digestive
  fluids is effected by the ordinary lining epithelium of the stomach or intestine, or both. In the
  remaining groups gastric glands are generally present in the form of simple caecal structures
  embedded in the submucosa and opening on the surface of the mucous membrane into the cavity of the
  stomach. The glands differ in different Fishes in the character of their lining epithelium and in
  the extent to which their component cells are differentiated from the epithelium of the stomach.
  There does not appear, however, to be any distinction into "central" (pepsin-forming) and
  "parietal" (acid-secreting) cells, as is the case in the higher Vertebrata. Towards the pyloric
  end of the stomach the true gastric glands are often replaced by mucous glands. There are,
  nevertheless, not a few Teleosts in which special gastric glands are absent, as, for example,
  <i>Syngnathus acus</i>, and several species of Cyprinidae, Labridae, and Blenniidae, etc. In at
  least two genera (<i>Gastrosteus</i> and <i>Cobitis</i>), belonging to widely different families,
  gastric glands are present in certain species but absent in others. As suggested by Edinger,<a
  id="NtA_259" href="#Nt_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a> the absence of these glands may possibly be due
  to degeneration.</p>

  <p>It may be remarked that the formation of such digestive ferments as pepsin and trypsin, which
  are associated with the stomach and pancreas respectively, in the higher Vertebrates, is not
  nearly so strictly localised in Cyclostomes and Fishes. So far from peptic digestion being limited
  to the stomach, it may take place in the pharynx, stomach, and intestine of Ammocoetes, and in
  some Elasmobranchs (e.g. <i>Scyllium</i>), and in such Teleosts as the Pike, Eel, and Carp, the
  peptic region extends from the stomach for some distance along the intestine, while trypsin has
  been obtained from the mucous membrane of the stomach, intestine and pyloric caeca, as well as
  from the pancreas.<a id="NtA_260" href="#Nt_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Intestinal glands analogous to the glands of Lieberk&uuml;hn in the higher Vertebrates seem to be
  entirely wanting in Fishes, unless represented by the sac-like or tubular crypts which are so
  generally present in the Teleostomi.</p>

  <p><b>The Liver.</b>&mdash;Phylogenetically the oldest gland in connexion with the Vertebrate
  alimentary canal, and in size by far the <span class="pagenum" id="page272"><span
  class="smaller">{272}</span></span>largest, the liver arises as a caecal outgrowth from the
  embryonic mesenteron, and in this primitive stage recapitulates a condition which is retained
  throughout life in Amphioxus. By the subsequent division and branching of this outgrowth the
  massive compound tubular gland of the adult Fish is eventually formed.</p>

  <p>The liver of Fishes (Figs. 153, 154) is very variable in size, shape, colour, and degree of
  lobulation. Anteriorly, it is usually moulded to the posterior face of the transverse septum
  between the pericardial and abdominal portions of the coelom, and from thence extends backwards in
  the abdominal cavity to a varying distance, in some Sharks as far as the cloaca. Externally, the
  gland is invested by the peritoneum, which extends on to it from the pericardial septum and forms
  a suspensory fold, and also from the oesophagus and stomach. The shape of the liver usually bears
  some relation to that of the body, being, for example, longest in the Eels and broadest in the
  Rays. In the great majority of Fishes the liver is bilobed, consisting of two sub-equal lateral
  lobes, disposed longitudinally and confluent anteriorly for a portion of their extent. From this
  normal type there are a few minor variations.<a id="NtA_261" href="#Nt_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a>
  In <i>Petromyzon</i>, <i>Lepidosteus</i> (Fig. 155, B), and a few Teleosts (<i>e.g.</i> the
  Gymnodontes, Lophobranchii, and some Salmonidae) the liver is unilobed. In the Myxinoids and in
  the Dipnoi (e.g. <i>Protopterus</i>), the organ is bilobed, but the small anterior lobe lies
  immediately in front of the much larger posterior lobe, with the gall-bladder between the two
  (Fig. 155, A). In some Teleosts (e.g. <i>Scomber</i>), the liver is trilobed. A gall-bladder is
  invariably present in either the larval or adult Cyclostomata, in the Chrondrostei, Holostei,
  Crossopterygii and Dipnoi, and generally also in Elasmobranchs and Teleosts. In the Elasmobranchs
  it is rarely entirely wanting, as in <i>Sphyrna</i> and <i>Pristis</i>, and in the Teleosts in
  some of the Gurnards (<i>Trigla</i>). The gall-bladder and bile-duct of <i>Petromyzon
  fluviatilis</i> atrophy after the metamorphosis which follows the larval <i>Ammocoetes</i> stage,
  but in <i>Petromyzon marinus</i> the duct, although usually absent, is sometimes retained. In the
  Ammocoetes the epithelium lining the gall-bladder is ciliated. In some Fishes, as, for example, in
  many Elasmobranchs, the gall-bladder is more or less completely embedded in the substance of the
  liver; in others, as in most Teleostomi, the organ is quite distinct from the gland (Fig.
  154).</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page273"><span class="smaller">{273}</span></span></div>

  <p>A simple arrangement of the ducts from the liver and gall-bladder is that found in the common
  Dog-Fish (<i>Scyllium canicula</i>). In this Elasmobranch a cystic duct leaves the gall-bladder,
  and, after receiving several hepatic ducts from the lobes of the liver, becomes the bile-duct and
  opens into the commencement of the intestine. In the Myxinoids and in the Dipnoi (e.g.
  <i>Protopterus</i>), there are but two hepatic ducts, one from each lobe of the liver; these unite
  and then meet the cystic duct to form the bile-duct (Fig. 155, A). The number of hepatic ducts
  may, however, be considerably increased, as, for example, in the Siluroid <i>Amiurus</i>,<a
  id="NtA_262" href="#Nt_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a> where 8-10 separate ducts join the cystic duct.
  In a few instances one of the hepatic ducts opens directly into the intestine, independently of
  that which unites with the cystic duct in forming the bile-duct. In the Dipnoi (e.g.
  <i>Protopterus</i>),<a id="NtA_263" href="#Nt_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a> and in some Teleostomi
  (e.g. <i>Lepidosteus</i>),<a id="NtA_264" href="#Nt_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a> the bile-duct
  receives the duct from the pancreas before opening into the intestine.</p>

  <p><b>The Pancreas.</b>&mdash;In the Cyclostomes (e.g. <i>Petromyzon</i>, <i>Bdellostoma</i>,
  <i>Myxine</i>) a rudimentary pancreas is apparently present, but the evidence as to its identity
  is not wholly conclusive. A well-developed pancreas occurs in Elasmobranchs, in at least one of
  the Dipnoi, and probably in most Teleostomi.<a id="NtA_265"
  href="#Nt_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In Elasmobranchs the pancreas is a compact structure, uni- or bi-lobed, and entirely distinct
  from the liver. In <i>Scyllium canicula</i> (Fig. 153), the bilobed gland lies in the angle
  between the distal limb of the stomach and the adjacent portion of the intestine, and from the
  smaller of its two lobes the duct issues to pass to its intestinal aperture near the commencement
  of the spiral valve. In most of the Teleostomi in which its existence has hitherto been recorded,
  the pancreas is a singularly diffuse gland; and usually a considerable portion, or even the whole
  of it, is embedded in the substance of the liver, its lobules accompanying the ramifications of
  the hepatic artery and duct, and the portal vein. The pancreatic duct usually opens into the
  intestine near the aperture of the bile duct (e.g. <i>Amiurus</i>); sometimes the two ducts open
  on the apex of a common papilla (e.g. <i>Acipenser</i> and <i>Amia</i>), or by their union form a
  common <span class="pagenum" id="page274"><span class="smaller">{274}</span></span>duct (e.g.
  <i>Lepidosteus</i>). Among the Dipnoi a well-developed pancreas is present in
  <i>Protopterus</i>,<a id="NtA_266" href="#Nt_266"><sup>[266]</sup></a> embedded in the wall of the
  stomach and intestine, internal to the peritoneal investment of these organs, and extending even
  into the first fold of the spiral valve. The gland is traversed by fine ductules which unite
  together and open into the bile-duct just before the latter enters the intestine. In the remaining
  Dipnoi the existence of a pancreas has yet to be ascertained. Developmentally, the pancreas
  resembles the liver, and, histologically, is very similar to that of the higher Vertebrates,
  consisting of terminal glandular alveoli continuous with intermediary tubular portions, and
  eventually with the finer ductules, which, by their union, form the main efferent duct.</p>

  <p><b>The Pyloric Caeca.</b>&mdash;These structures are caecal outgrowths from the intestine, and
  are situated close to the pyloric extremity of the stomach and the intestinal apertures of the
  bile and pancreatic ducts. Wholly wanting in the Cyclostomata and Dipnoi, and, unless represented
  by a pair of caeca opening into the long, tubular, non-valvate anterior portion of the intestine
  in the Greenland Shark (<i>Laemargus borealis</i>),<a id="NtA_267"
  href="#Nt_267"><sup>[267]</sup></a> in the Elasmobranchs also, they are very generally present in
  the Teleostomi, although extremely variable both in number and arrangement in different families.
  In <i>Amia</i> there is no trace of pyloric caeca. <i>Polypterus</i> has a single short caecum
  with a thick muscular wall. In <i>Acipenser</i>, <i>Polyodon</i>, and <i>Lepidosteus</i>, on the
  contrary, pyloric caeca are unusually well developed. In <i>Acipenser</i> the caeca are not only
  numerous, but are so connected together by connective tissue and blood-vessels, and so invested
  externally by the peritoneum, as to form a large, compact, gland-like mass, communicating with the
  intestine by a single wide duct. In <i>Polyodon</i> the organ is essentially similar, but is lobed
  externally. In <i>Lepidosteus</i> (Fig. 155, B, <i>py.c</i>), the caeca are also very numerous,
  but relatively short, and, although united into a compact mass, open by four pit-like orifices
  into the intestinal cavity. In Teleosts the caeca are subject to extraordinary variations in
  number, size, and arrangement.<a id="NtA_268" href="#Nt_268"><sup>[268]</sup></a> In some
  families, and even in groups of higher taxonomic value, they are entirely absent, as is the case
  with the <span class="pagenum" id="page275"><span class="smaller">{275}</span></span>Siluridae,
  Esocidae, Cyprinodontidae, Labridae, Plectognathi, and Lophobranchii. The "Sand-eel"
  (<i>Ammodytes</i>) has but a single caecum; the Turbot (<i>Rhombus maximus</i>) two, and other
  Pleuronectidae three to five; and the Perch (<i>Perca</i>), three (Fig. 160, <i>py.c</i>).</p>

  <p>In other Teleosts, on the contrary, these structures are much more numerous. In <i>Labrus
  labrax</i> there are about 60, in the Whiting (<i>Gadus merlangus</i>) 120, while in the Mackerel
  (<i>Scomber scombrus</i>) there are no fewer than 191. If few in number the caeca open separately
  into the intestine, but when numerous, more or fewer of them may unite to form a smaller number of
  efferent ducts, as in the Whiting, where four such ducts are formed. In some instances, as in the
  Tunny (<i>Thunnus</i>), the union of the caeca by connective tissue leads to the formation of a
  compact mass. As regards their arrangement, the caeca may either be disposed in a whorl round the
  intestine, as in the Whiting, or in a linear series, as in the Salmon (<i>Salmo</i>) and in some
  of the Clupeidae.</p>

  <p>The mucous membrane lining the anterior pyloric caeca is often developed into a network of
  ridges, limiting crypt-like or tubular depressions; and not infrequently the epithelium is
  ciliated.</p>

  <p>The precise function of these organs, whether digestive or absorptive, is still uncertain.<a
  id="NtA_269" href="#Nt_269"><sup>[269]</sup></a> That they may be digestive is suggested by the
  presence of certain amylolytic and proteolytic enzymes, but this obvious conclusion is to some
  extent vitiated by the close proximity of these organs to the stomach, and more especially to the
  intestinal orifice of the pancreatic duct. It is by no means improbable, however, that the caeca
  are both digestive and absorptive organs. An attempt has been made to show that the pyloric caeca
  and the spiral valve vary inversely as regards the extent of their development in different groups
  of <span class="pagenum" id="page276"><span class="smaller">{276}</span></span>Fishes.<a
  id="NtA_270" href="#Nt_270"><sup>[270]</sup></a> To some extent the reciprocal variation of these
  structures supports this view, but it is also evident that there are obvious objections to its
  unqualified acceptance. Thus, in some Teleostomi (e.g. <i>Acipenser</i>, <i>Polyodon</i>),
  exceptionally well-developed and numerous caeca and a spiral valve are both present. <i>Amia</i>
  with an almost vestigial spiral valve has no trace of pyloric caeca, and in Teleosts the absence
  of a spiral valve is associated with the complete suppression of the caeca in many large and
  important groups.</p>

  <p class="sp5"><b>The Rectal Gland.</b>&mdash;The "rectal" gland, or appendix digitiformis, is a
  small organ of unknown function with complex glandular walls, and a central duct opening dorsally
  into the terminal portion of the intestine.<a id="NtA_271" href="#Nt_271"><sup>[271]</sup></a> The
  organ is generally present in Elasmobranchs (Fig. 153, <i>rct.gl</i>), in which group the
  intestinal orifice of its duct may either be close to the termination of the spiral valve, or, as
  in <i>Chlamydoselachus</i>,<a id="NtA_272" href="#Nt_272"><sup>[272]</sup></a> near the cloacal
  outlet of the gut. An apparent representative of the gland, the "caecum cloacae," is also present
  in the Dipnoi,<a id="NtA_273" href="#Nt_273"><sup>[273]</sup></a> but communicates directly with
  the cloaca (Fig. 155, A, <i>cl.c</i>). The "rectal" gland is perhaps homologous with the
  intestinal caecum which is to be found in some Teleosts (e.g. <i>Box vulgaris</i>), and possibly
  also with the "caecum" (caecum coli), and its vermiform appendix in the higher Vertebrata.<a
  id="NtA_274" href="#Nt_274"><sup>[274]</sup></a> The caecum cloacae, on the contrary, is
  morphologically a urogenital sinus, formed as a dilatation of the fused hinder portions of the
  mesonephric ducts, and probably comparable with the sperm sacs of male Elasmobranchs, and also
  with the urinary bladder of Teleostomes.<a id="NtA_275" href="#Nt_275"><sup>[275]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="smaller">THE RESPIRATORY
  ORGANS</span></p>

  <p>The principal respiratory organs consist of a series of pairs of branchial clefts in the form
  of perforations in the side walls of the throat, which place the pharynx in free communication
  with the exterior. The first and most anterior of these clefts, the mandibulo-hyoid cleft or
  "spiracle," is situated between the mandibular and hyoid arches; the second, the hyo-branchial or
  hyoidean cleft, between the hyoid arch and the first branchial arch; and the remaining clefts
  between the succeeding branchial arches. On the anterior and posterior walls of more or fewer of
  the clefts highly vascular plate-like, or variously shaped filamentous outgrowths of their lining
  membrane are developed, which subserve the purpose of exposing the blood to the influence of the
  oxygen-containing water, and are termed branchial lamellae or "gills." In addition to their usual
  respiratory organs, the gills, a few Fishes utilise the air-bladder either as a functional lung or
  as an oxygen reservoir, and in others accessory breathing organs of various kinds are
  developed.</p>

  <p>The arrangement of the branchial clefts and the gills may be conveniently studied first in the
  Elasmobranchs. Excluding the spiracles, there are usually in this group (Fig. 161, A), five pairs
  of branchial clefts, but in certain primitive members of the group the number may be larger. Thus,
  in <i>Notidanus griseus</i> (<i>Hexanchus</i>) and in <i>Chlamydoselachus</i> there are six, and
  in <i>Notidanus cinereus</i> (<i>Heptanchus</i>), seven clefts. The pharyngeal apertures of the
  clefts are relatively wide, but their external openings, which are freely exposed on the lateral
  surface of the head between the eye and the pectoral fin, are usually narrow and slit-like.</p>

  <p>The successive clefts are separated from one another by a series of inter-branchial septa, each
  of which consists of the lining membrane of two contiguous clefts and a median fibrous sheet; it
  is further strengthened on its pharyngeal margin by a branchial arch, and more externally by the
  fringe of cartilaginous rods (branchial rays) with which the outer convex edge of each arch is
  provided. The anterior and posterior walls of each septum are produced into a number of
  outwardly-radiating vascular plates or folds (branchial lamellae or "gills"), which by their free
  edges project into the cavity of the cleft (Fig. 161, A). Although slightly free at their outer
  extremities, the lamellae do not extend so far as the external margin of the septum to which they
  are attached (Fig. 164, B). Each series of lamellae is termed a "hemibranch," and, from what has
  been said, it is obvious that each inter-branchial septum and its supporting branchial arch carry
  two hemibranchs, an anterior and a posterior, the two forming a complete biserial gill or
  "holobranch." The hyoid arch, however, has only a single hemibranch, viz. that pertaining to the
  anterior wall of the hyo-branchial cleft, and as the fifth or last cleft has a hemibranch only on
  its anterior wall, the fifth arch is <span class="pagenum" id="page279"><span
  class="smaller">{279}</span></span>gill-less.<a id="NtA_276" href="#Nt_276"><sup>[276]</sup></a>
  The spiracle is a vestigial cleft. At an early stage of embryonic growth it differs but little
  from its fellows, but subsequently degenerating it is represented in the adult by a tubular
  passage between the oral cavity and the exterior, which, however, is often complicated by the
  development of caecal outgrowths.<a id="NtA_277" href="#Nt_277"><sup>[277]</sup></a> The anterior
  wall of the spiracle often retains a rudiment of a hemibranch in the shape of more or fewer
  vascular lamellae, which, as they are supplied with arterial blood, and not with venous blood like
  the ordinary gills, are said to form a mandibular or spiracular "pseudobranch." The spiracle
  varies greatly in size in different families, being largest in the Trygons and Torpedos, and very
  small, or even absent in the Lamnidae. Its pseudobranch is best developed in the Notidanidae,
  where it has the essential structure of a true hemibranch, and, as in other Elasmobranchs, but to
  a greater extent, probably aids in the additional aeration of the blood which is distributed to
  the eye and brain. The characteristic opercular covering of the external apertures of the
  gill-clefts in the Teleostomi and Dipnoi is wanting in Elasmobranchs. It is interesting to note,
  however, that in <i>Chlamydoselachus</i><a id="NtA_278" href="#Nt_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a>
  curious frilled cutaneous folds are developed as extensions of the outer edges of the
  inter-branchial septa, as well as of the hyoid region, and, like a series of incipient opercula,
  project backwards over the successive branchial clefts (Fig. 252).</p>

  <p>While in many respects more primitive than in Elasmobranchs the branchial system of the
  Cyclostomata presents certain special and peculiar features. The branchial clefts assume the form
  of oval, antero-posteriorly flattened pouches or sacs, varying, however, in number, and in their
  mode of communicating with the exterior, in different genera. In the Lamprey (<i>Petromyzon</i>)
  there are seven pairs of obliquely-disposed gill-sacs opening externally by small rounded
  orifices, and by similar apertures, not directly into the pharynx, but into a branchial canal
  (Fig. 162, <i>r.t</i>), which underlies the oesophagus, and, while ending blindly behind the last
  pair of sacs, communicating in <span class="pagenum" id="page280"><span
  class="smaller">{280}</span></span>front with the oral cavity.<a id="NtA_279"
  href="#Nt_279"><sup>[279]</sup></a> The first of the series of gill-sacs corresponds to the
  hyo-branchial or hyoidean cleft of Elasmobranchs and other Fishes. Spiracles are absent in the
  adult, but in the embryo are represented by pouch-like outgrowths of the hypoblast of the oral
  cavity, which subsequently undergo singular changes.<a id="NtA_280"
  href="#Nt_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a> Thus, the outgrowths become converted into the lateral halves
  of a complete ciliated circum-oral groove, which is retained even in the Ammocoetes stage, and
  recalls the ciliated peripharyngeal ring of Ascidians. Another archaic feature is also to be noted
  in the continuity of the groove with a ciliated mid-dorsal pharyngeal ridge, which has been
  compared to the "dorsal lamina" of Ascidians, and to the equally characteristic hyperbranchial
  groove of <i>Amphioxus</i>.<a id="NtA_281" href="#Nt_281"><sup>[281]</sup></a> Ventrally also, the
  lateral halves of the groove unite to form a single groove, which, after receiving the median
  aperture of the thyroid rudiment,<a id="NtA_282" href="#Nt_282"><sup>[282]</sup></a> is continued
  backwards in the mid-ventral line of the pharyngeal wall as far as the last branchial arch. No
  trace of these ciliated structures is, however, to be met with in the adult.</p>

  <p>The branchial lamellae are represented by a series of vascular horizontal and parallel ridges
  radiating outwards along the roof, floor, and lateral walls of each gill-sac, and invested by an
  <span class="pagenum" id="page281"><span class="smaller">{281}</span></span>epithelium which is
  partially ciliated. The inter-branchial septa are much thicker than in Elasmobranchs, and include
  not only the walls of adjacent sacs and the branchial muscles, but also contain cavernous
  peribranchial lymph-sinuses. The cartilaginous branchial skeleton is situated wholly external to
  the gill-sacs, the so-called branchial arches lying between the external apertures of the sacs,
  and directly beneath the superficial skin, or, in other words, on the outer margins of the
  inter-branchial septa, and not on the inner, as is invariably the case with the branchial arches
  of Fishes.</p>

  <p>In the Hag-Fish (<i>Myxine</i>) (Fig. 163), there are usually six, very rarely seven, pairs of
  gill-sacs, all of which open directly into the pharynx, and not into a branchial canal as in the
  Lampreys. On the other hand, <i>Myxine</i> is unique in having the outer extremities of its
  gill-sacs produced into a corresponding number of tubular canals which, after a longer or shorter
  course obliquely backwards and outwards, unite to form on each side a ventrally-situated external
  aperture (Fig. 163). In the same genus a short canal, or oesophageo-cutaneous duct, passes from
  the pharynx <span class="pagenum" id="page282"><span class="smaller">{282}</span></span>behind the
  last gill-sac of the left side, and opens externally with the common external branchial aperture
  of that side.</p>

  <p>In <i>Bdellostoma</i> there are usually six or seven pairs of gill-sacs, but some species have
  ten or even fourteen pairs.<a id="NtA_283" href="#Nt_283"><sup>[283]</sup></a> They agree with
  those of the Lamprey in having independent external apertures, but resemble the corresponding
  organs in <i>Myxine</i> in opening directly into the pharynx. An oesophageo-cutaneous duct is also
  present.<a id="NtA_284" href="#Nt_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the Holocephali there are but four branchial clefts, the fifth cleft being closed. Spiracles
  are absent in the adult, although present in the young of <i>Chimaera</i>. The branchial lamellae
  resemble those of Elasmobranchs, but the inter-branchial septa are somewhat shorter, so that the
  lamellae project slightly beyond their outer margins (Fig. 164, B). A hyoidean hemibranch is
  present. A noteworthy feature is the development of a cutaneous fold from the outer surface of the
  hyoid arch, which grows backwards over the gill-clefts, and, uniting above and below with the
  body-wall, terminates in a free posterior margin, just behind the last gill-cleft. By the growth
  of this opercular fold the gills become enclosed in a spacious branchial cavity, and the clefts
  communicate with the exterior through a slit-like opening between the free margin of the fold and
  the body-wall.</p>

  <p>The reduction in the extent of the inter-branchial septa which is initiated in the Holocephali
  is carried to a still further extent in the Teleostomi. Commencing with the Chondrostei, and
  passing thence to the more specialised Teleostei, the septa become gradually reduced in length,
  and the branchial lamellae project freely beyond their outer margins to an increasing extent.</p>

  <p>This modification, least marked in <i>Acipenser</i> (Fig. 164, C) and <i>Polyodon</i>, attains
  its maximum in the Teleosts (Fig. 164, D and E), where the branchial lamellae take the form of a
  double series of free filaments disposed along the convex outer margin of each branchial arch, and
  attached by their bases only to the reduced and inconspicuous septa. As a general rule each of the
  first four arches supports two hemibranchs,<a id="NtA_285" href="#Nt_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a>
  forming a <span class="pagenum" id="page283"><span class="smaller">{283}</span></span>biserial
  gill or holobranch. In shape the branchial filaments are usually somewhat triangular, and consist
  of an axial supporting cartilage or bone, invested superficially by a highly vascular mucous
  membrane. As in most of the preceding groups the fifth branchial arch is gill-less. All Teleostomi
  possess a well-developed movable operculum, supported by a more or less complete series of
  opercular bones, with or without the addition of branchiostegal rays (Fig. 161, B). The size of
  the external branchial aperture varies considerably. Usually the hinder and lower margins of the
  operculum are free, and then the aperture is spacious. Not infrequently, however, the more or less
  extensive fusion of the ventral and hinder edges of the operculum with the body-wall reduces the
  aperture to a narrow slit, as in the Eels and some Siluridae, or to a small upwardly directed
  pore, as in the "Sea-Horse" (<i>Hippocampus</i>). In the Symbranchidae the branchial apertures
  close dorsally, but fuse ventrally, leaving a single median orifice on the under side of the
  throat.</p>

  <p>Open spiracles are wanting in most adult Teleostomi, but are, nevertheless, retained in the
  Crossopterygii (<i>Polypterus</i>), and in the Chondrostei (<i>Acipenser</i> and <i>Polyodon</i>).
  They have been observed, however, in the embryos of some Teleosts, as in the Salmon
  (<i>Salmo</i>),<a id="NtA_286" href="#Nt_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a> and even in the adults of
  <i>Amia</i>,<a id="NtA_287" href="#Nt_287"><sup>[287]</sup></a> <i>Lepidosteus</i>, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page284"><span class="smaller">{284}</span></span>and a few Teleosts<a
  id="NtA_288" href="#Nt_288"><sup>[288]</sup></a> are represented by pouch-like recesses of the
  oral cavity. A few vestigial branchial lamellae may be developed on the anterior wall of each
  spiracle in <i>Acipenser</i> and <i>Polyodon</i>, but are wanting in <i>Polypterus</i>, and, as in
  Elasmobranchs, represent a mandibular or spiracular pseudobranch.</p>

  <p>The structure usually regarded as a hyoidean hemibranch in the Teleostomi differs greatly in
  its development in different members of the group. In <i>Acipenser</i> it is undoubtedly the
  hemibranch of the hyoid arch and is a true gill, receiving venous blood from the ventral aorta and
  returning arterial blood to the dorsal aorta, as in Elasmobranchs. In <i>Polyodon</i> and in
  <i>Polypterus</i> the hemibranch is suppressed. <i>Lepidosteus</i>,<a id="NtA_289"
  href="#Nt_289"><sup>[289]</sup></a> on the other hand, has two series of lamellae on the inner
  surface of the operculum, a dorsal and a ventral series meeting at an angle (Fig. 197). The
  ventral lamellae are supplied with venous blood, the dorsal with arterial,<a id="NtA_290"
  href="#Nt_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a> so that while the former retain their primitive character as a
  functional hyoidean hemibranch, the latter is a pseudobranch. It is interesting to note, however,
  that the development of this pseudobranch and its blood-vessels proves that it does not represent
  any portion of a true hyoidean hemibranch, but is really a spiracular pseudobranch.<a id="NtA_291"
  href="#Nt_291"><sup>[291]</sup></a> In most other Teleostomi a degenerate hemibranch occupies a
  similar position. In <i>Amia</i><a id="NtA_292" href="#Nt_292"><sup>[292]</sup></a> it is very
  feebly developed, and is lodged in a canal communicating with the branchial cavity by a small
  aperture, and situated directly anterior to the dorsal end of the first branchial arch. Its blood
  supply is arterial, and the organ is therefore a pseudobranch. In Teleosts the hemibranch is
  invariably a pseudobranch; nevertheless, its primitive condition as a gill is indicated either by
  its structure or by its embryonic history. In some genera the pseudobranch consists of short free
  lamellae, as in some Pleuronectidae; or it is partly free and partly concealed, as in some of the
  Horse Mackerels (<i>Caranx</i>) and in <i>Salmo</i>; or it may be completely hidden beneath the
  oral epithelium, as in the Cod (<i>Gadus</i>), where the organ is very degenerate, and is little
  more than a "rete mirabile" of blood-vessels. The nature of the Teleostean pseudobranch is not in
  <span class="pagenum" id="page285"><span class="smaller">{285}</span></span>all cases quite clear.
   In <i>Salmo</i> it is said that there is no hyoidean hemibranch, and that the pseudobranch is
  really a persistent spiracular pseudobranch;<a id="NtA_293" href="#Nt_293"><sup>[293]</sup></a>
  hence it is probable that a like significance must be attached to this singular structure in other
  Teleosts. The evidence of the cranial nerves on this point is conflicting. If the pseudobranch
  pertains to the spiracular cleft its nerve supply should be derived from the nerve of that
  cleft&mdash;viz. the seventh or facial nerve; but if it represents a hyoidean hemibranch, then one
  would expect it to be innervated by the ninth or glossopharyngeal nerve. As a matter of fact,
  however, the organ is said to be supplied by the seventh in some Teleosts, and in others by the
  ninth nerve.</p>

  <p>In the Dipnoi the branchial system is best developed in <i>Neoceratodus</i>, the increasing
  importance of the lungs as respiratory organs in <i>Protopterus</i> and <i>Lepidosiren</i> being
  associated with a corresponding reduction in the structural and functional development of the
  gills. There is no trace of spiracles in the adult.</p>

  whole length to a well-developed interbranchial septum (Fig. 165). A peculiarity of
  <i>Neoceratodus</i>, which has no counterpart in any other Fishes, is the extension of the
  branchial lamellae on to the dorsal and ventral walls of the branchial clefts, so that the
  hemibranchs on opposite sides of each cleft are continuous both dorsally and ventrally (Fig. 166).

  <p>In <i>Protopterus</i><a id="NtA_295" href="#Nt_295"><sup>[295]</sup></a> the number of
  branchial arches is increased to six, but, in consequence of the closure of the hyobranchial
  cleft, there are but five open clefts. The first, second, and third arches are wholly devoid of
  branchial filaments: the fourth and fifth support each a biserial gill, while the sixth arch
  retains only an anterior hemibranch, which, however, as the source of its blood supply seems to
  indicate, may consist of "emigrant" gill-filaments from the posterior hemibranch of the fifth
  arch.<a id="NtA_296" href="#Nt_296"><sup>[296]</sup></a> Interbranchial septa are practically
  non-existent, the flattened, leaf-like gill-lamellae being free except at their attached bases,
  and thus repeating a characteristic Teleostean feature. A "hyoidean" hemibranch or pseudobranch,
  supplied from the ventral aorta, is present, but as the hyobranchial cleft is closed it projects
  into the branchial cavity immediately in front of the cleft between the first and second branchial
  arches. In <i>Lepidosiren</i><a id="NtA_297" href="#Nt_297"><sup>[297]</sup></a> the branchial
  arches are reduced to five and the clefts to four, the hyobranchial and fifth clefts being closed.
  There is a "hyoidean" hemibranch resembling that of <i>Protopterus</i>.</p>

  <p>The facts furnished by the study of the numerical and structural variations in the gill-clefts,
  gills, and gill-arches of different groups of Fishes prove that atrophy of these structures takes
  place at opposite ends of the series. We have examples of this anteriorly in the suppression of
  the hyo-mandibular cleft and its hemibranch, and of the hyoidean hemibranch, as the result of
  <span class="pagenum" id="page287"><span class="smaller">{287}</span></span>the conversion of the
  mandibular and hyoid arches into jaws, or into skeletal supports for the jaws; and posteriorly, in
  the reduction which is evident when the generality of Fishes are compared with such primitive
  Elasmobranchs as <i>Chlamydoselachus</i> and <i>Notidanus</i>.</p>

  <p>In most Fishes the concave pharyngeal margins of the branchial arches are fringed with a double
  series of either cartilaginous or bony tubercles or filaments, the "gill-rakers" (Figs. 161 and
  164). The anterior row of gill-rakers on each arch usually interdigitate with those of the
  posterior row on the preceding arch, and in this way the two rows form a sieve-like mechanism to
  prevent any solid particles, which may enter the pharynx with the respiratory current of water,
  from passing into the gill clefts and clogging or otherwise injuring the branchial filaments.</p>

  <p>In a few Fishes the gill-rakers are enormously developed, and subserve a function similar to
  that of the baleen plates of the Whalebone Whales in acting as a filter for straining from the
  water the small pelagic organisms on which the Fish feeds. This is notably the case in the great
  Basking Shark (<i>Selache maxima</i>)<a id="NtA_298" href="#Nt_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a> in which
  the closely-set, flattened, tapering gill-rakers may be so long as four or five inches, and, while
  somewhat resembling "whalebone" in appearance, have the histological structure of vascular
  dentine. The nature of the food, which in the stomach of one specimen examined consisted solely of
  an immense quantity of plankton, including Copepods and the larvae of other Crustaceans,<a
  id="NtA_299" href="#Nt_299"><sup>[299]</sup></a> affords clear evidence of the great value of such
  a filtering mechanism to this Shark, and, at the same time offers an explanation of the striking
  and significant reduction in the size of the teeth, which, relatively to the dimensions of the
  Fish, are so small as to be almost vestigial. A similar filter has been observed in an extinct
  <i>Selache</i> (<i>S. aurata</i>)<a id="NtA_300" href="#Nt_300"><sup>[300]</sup></a> from the
  Antwerp Crag, and also in an existing South African Shark (<i>Rhinodon typicus</i>);<a
  id="NtA_301" href="#Nt_301"><sup>[301]</sup></a> and in the latter, as in the Basking Shark, is
  associated with a marked reduction in the importance of the dentition. The long slender
  gill-rakers of the Chondrostean <span class="pagenum" id="page288"><span
  class="smaller">{288}</span></span><i>Polyodon</i> also constitute an efficient filter, and the
  same may be said of several plankton-eating Teleosts.</p>

  <p><b>The Mechanism of Respiration.</b>&mdash;The aeration of the blood is effected by the
  rhythmical suction of water into the oral cavity, and its subsequent expulsion through the
  gill-clefts, bathing the highly vascular gill-lamellae in its course. In any single act of
  inspiration the mouth is opened, and the oral cavity enlarged by the lateral expansion of its
  walls. When the oral cavity is filled with water, the mouth is closed and the expiratory process
  begins. By the lateral contraction of the oral walls the water is driven outwards through the
  gill-clefts, and over the gill-lamellae. During this process the branchial arches become widely
  separated by the contraction of their muscles, the operculum is elevated, and the oesophagus is
  closed by the contraction of its muscular wall. In many Fishes the course of the expiratory
  water-current is controlled by special valve-like folds of the oral mucous membrane, the maxillary
  and mandibular "breathing-valves."<a id="NtA_302" href="#Nt_302"><sup>[302]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The rate of "breathing" varies considerably in different Fishes, even in allied species.<a
  id="NtA_303" href="#Nt_303"><sup>[303]</sup></a> In the Blue Wrasse (<i>Labrus</i>), and the
  Rockling (<i>Motella</i>), the number of respirations per minute is 15, in the Minnow
  (<i>Leuciscus</i>), and Stickleback (<i>Gastrosteus</i>), as many as 150. A deficiency of oxygen
  in the water accelerates the respiratory movements, and the Fish appears to "pant" or breathe
  hurriedly. In the Lampreys, both inspiration and expiration may take place through the external
  gill-apertures by the alternate expansion and contraction of the gill-sacs, more especially when
  the suctorial buccal funnel is used for the attachment of the animal. On the other hand, the
  singular habits of the Myxinoids involve a further modification of the respiratory process. In
  these Cyclostomata the inspiratory current enters the external naso-pituitary aperture and reaches
  the pharynx through the naso-pituitary canal, and thence, as an expiratory stream, traverses the
  gill-sacs on its way outwards. The pharynx is closed behind the last pair of gill-sacs by a
  constrictor muscle, which prevents the entrance of the water into the oesophagus, and converts the
  pharynx into a respiratory tube for the time <span class="pagenum" id="page289"><span
  class="smaller">{289}</span></span>being; but, when food is being swallowed, the pharyngeal
  constrictor is relaxed and the internal apertures of the gill-sacs are closed by the contraction
  of their own sphincter muscles.</p>

  <p>In addition to the usual respiratory organs it is probable that in not a few Fishes the
  superficial skin may share with the gills the function of breathing. In this connexion may be
  mentioned the fact that in <i>Periophthalmus</i> the tail is used for respiration. Hickson<a
  id="NtA_304" href="#Nt_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a> observed that a species of this genus,
  frequenting the extensive sandy shores of the Island of Celebes, often rests with its tail in the
  water, the head and trunk being exposed. Under such circumstances the gills are probably of little
  use, and the tail is utilised as a breathing organ, principally, as Haddon<a id="NtA_305"
  href="#Nt_305"><sup>[305]</sup></a> subsequently pointed out, through the agency of its extremely
  vascular caudal fin.</p>

  <p>Some Fishes possess larval breathing organs; others, even when provided with gills, either
  utilise the air-bladder, or develop special accessory organs, for aquatic or, more usually, for
  aerial respiration.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Larval Gills.</b>&mdash;In early life many Fishes acquire larval gills, either as the result
  of the precocious growth of the normal gills, or by reason of the development of evanescent
  structures. In the embryos of Elasmobranchs "external gills," in the form of long filiform
  processes invested by hypoblast, are developed from the walls of all the branchial clefts,
  including the spiracles, and protrude outwards for some distance through the external apertures of
  the clefts (Fig. 167, B). They perhaps facilitate respiration within the egg, as they completely
  disappear after hatching; but there is also reason for believing that they aid in the absorption
  of nutriment. Similar gills are present in young Holocephali. In some larval Teleosts, as in
  certain genera of the Osteoglossidae and Mormyridae (e.g. <i>Heterotis</i> and
  <i>Gymnarchus</i>)<a id="NtA_306" href="#Nt_306"><sup>[306]</sup></a> these structures are
  remarkably developed (Fig. 239). The young of the Loach (<i>Misgurnus</i>) and of the Salmon
  (<i>Salmo</i>) also have the ordinary gill-filaments prolonged externally as filiform structures,
  which subsequently become reduced to their normal size.<a id="NtA_307"
  href="#Nt_307"><sup>[307]</sup></a> In its larval state <i>Polypterus</i><a id="NtA_308"
  href="#Nt_308"><sup>[308]</sup></a> has a pair of pinnately-fringed ectodermal or cutaneous gills
  projecting from the lateral surfaces of the head behind and above the external branchial apertures
  (Figs. 168 and 281). Apparently as an individual peculiarity the right gill has been retained in a
  specimen of <i>P. congicus</i> so large as 22 cm. in length, although the left one had entirely
  disappeared.<a id="NtA_309" href="#Nt_309"><sup>[309]</sup></a> Each gill is supplied with blood
  from the ventral aorta by a vessel which ascends the <span class="pagenum" id="page291"><span
  class="smaller">{291}</span></span>hyoid arch, and is apparently the representative of the artery
  supplying the hyoidean hemibranch in Elasmobranchs. The efferent vessel of each gill joins the
  common trunk formed by the union of the efferent vessels of the normal gills of the same side.</p>

  <p>The cutaneous gills of the Dipnoid <i>Protopterus</i> may also be included in the category of
  larval breathing organs. They consist of three simple unbranched filaments on each side of the
  head, and, as in <i>Polypterus</i>, are situated at the dorsal extremity of the external gill
  aperture (Fig. 309). Although usually represented in the relatively young or half grown specimens
  which, so far, have reached Europe, it is extremely probable that these organs atrophy in older
  individuals. Similar gills are present in the larval <i>Lepidosiren</i> (Fig. 311), but disappear
  at a much earlier stage. At no period of its development are larval gills present in
  <i>Neoceratodus</i>.<a id="NtA_310" href="#Nt_310"><sup>[310]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>The Air-Bladder as a respiratory Organ.</b>&mdash;In certain Fishes the air-bladder may
  become subservient to the function of respiration. In <i>Amia</i> and <i>Lepidosteus</i> the
  internally sacculated and vascular air-bladder is obviously adapted for air-breathing, and there
  are not wanting observations<a id="NtA_311" href="#Nt_311"><sup>[311]</sup></a> which suggest that
  the organ is actually used for this purpose after the fashion of a lung. According to Jobert,<a
  id="NtA_312" href="#Nt_312"><sup>[312]</sup></a> this is also the case with the sacculated
  air-bladder of certain Brazilian Teleosts, viz. <i>Sudis gigas</i>, <i>Erythrinus taeniatus</i>
  and <i>E. braziliensis</i>, since these Fishes die of asphyxia when the organ is cut off from
  communication with the exterior by the ligature of its ductus pneumaticus. It is in the Dipnoi,
  however, that the air-bladder becomes most completely a true lung. In <i>Neoceratodus</i><a
  id="NtA_313" href="#Nt_313"><sup>[313]</sup></a> the lung is probably of the greatest use to the
  Fish when the rivers are low during the hot season and the water is charged with foul gases from
  decomposing vegetable matter, and possibly also when the water is filled with sediment in the
  rainy season. In <i>Protopterus</i>, and more especially in <i>Lepidosiren</i>, the partial
  atrophy of the gills renders it highly probable that the lungs are the principal breathing organs
  at all times. Nevertheless, it must be emphasised that in all these Fishes respiration by means of
  the air-bladder <span class="pagenum" id="page292"><span
  class="smaller">{292}</span></span>necessarily involves a transit of air to and from that organ
  through the ductus pneumaticus, and at present nothing is known as to the method by which such
  inspiratory and expiratory currents can be produced.<a id="NtA_314"
  href="#Nt_314"><sup>[314]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There is also some experimental evidence for the belief that the air-bladder of some Teleosts
  may be subsidiary to respiration by acting as a reservoir for the superabundance of oxygen which
  is taken into the blood through the gills, and subsequently reabsorbed into the blood when the
  Fish is in water containing relatively little oxygen.<a id="NtA_315"
  href="#Nt_315"><sup>[315]</sup></a> It is clear, however, that the conditions under which the
  air-bladder can be used in this way are by no means fully understood, for, under experiment, such
  Fishes died of asphyxia even though after death the air-bladder still contained upwards of fifty
  per cent of oxygen.</p>

  <p><b>Accessory Organs of Respiration.</b>&mdash;In certain Fishes of peculiar habits, or living
  under special external conditions, accessory respiratory organs are developed.</p>

  <p>Although in this particular instance no special organs are formed, mention may first be made of
  the singular method of intestinal respiration in vogue in some Teleosts. In one of the Loaches
  (<i>Misgurnus fossilis</i>),<a id="NtA_316" href="#Nt_316"><sup>[316]</sup></a> air is swallowed
  and passed along the alimentary canal until it is finally voided at the anus. The mucous membrane
  of the intestine is extremely vascular, and hence the blood comes into sufficiently intimate
  relations with the swallowed air to admit of it exchanging carbon dioxide for oxygen. Intestinal
  respiration also occurs in species of the South American freshwater genera of Siluridae and
  Loricariidae, <i>Callichthys</i>, <i>Doras</i>, <i>Loricaria</i>, and <i>Plecostomus</i>;<a
  id="NtA_317" href="#Nt_317"><sup>[317]</sup></a> and in some cases the area of respiratory surface
  is considerably increased by the development of folds and processes of the intestinal mucous
  membrane.</p>

  <p>In a few tropical Teleosts curious labyrinthiform organs are developed in connexion with
  certain of the branchial arches, and serve as accessory breathing organs. In the Indian "Climbing
  Perch" (<i>Anabas scandens</i>),<a id="NtA_318" href="#Nt_318"><sup>[318]</sup></a> of the family
  Anabantidae, the organ (Fig. 169) consists of three or more concentrically-arranged bony <span
  class="pagenum" id="page293"><span class="smaller">{293}</span></span>laminae, with wavy,
  crenulated margins, attached by a common bony base to the upper extremity of the fourth branchial
  arch, and enclosed in a special dorsal enlargement of the branchial cavity. The vascular membrane
  which invests the laminae is abundantly supplied with venous blood by a branch of the fourth
  afferent branchial artery, the equivalent efferent vessel joining the dorsal aorta. Essentially
  similar organs are found in several genera of Osphromenidae (e.g. <i>Polyacanthus</i>,
  <i>Osphromenus</i>, and <i>Trichogaster</i>). A simpler form of respiratory organ of somewhat the
  same type occurs in the Indian family Ophiocephalidae.<a id="NtA_319"
  href="#Nt_319"><sup>[319]</sup></a> In these Fishes there is, on each side, an accessory branchial
  cavity, situated above that which contains the gills, but freely communicating with it (Fig. 170).
  The cavity is lined by a thickened and puckered vascular membrane, but otherwise contains no
  special respiratory structures.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the Siluroid genera <i>Clarias</i> and <i>Heterobranchus</i> the accessory organ takes the
  form of branched, arborescent and highly vascular structures, developed as outgrowths from the
  dorsal extremities of one or two branchial arches, and enclosed within a posterior and dorsal
  expansion of the proper branchial cavity (Fig. 171).</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page294"><span class="smaller">{294}</span></span></div>

  <p>Another example of these interesting structures occurs in <i>Chanos salmoneus</i> and a few
  other Clupeidae<a id="NtA_320" href="#Nt_320"><sup>[320]</sup></a> in the shape of a coiled
  gill-like organ ("gill-helix"), which is supported by the dorsal segment of the fourth branchial
  arch, and enclosed in a similarly curved caecal extension of the branchial cavity. Each gill
  derives its blood from the fourth afferent branchial artery, the corresponding efferent vessel
  joining the fourth efferent branchial artery. A similar spirally-coiled "gill-helix" is found also
  in <i>Heterotis ehrenbergii</i>,<a id="NtA_321" href="#Nt_321"><sup>[321]</sup></a> amongst the
  Osteoglossidae, and in several species of Characinidae.<a id="NtA_322"

  </div>

  <p>In other Teleosts the accessory breathing organ assumes the condition of paired lung-like
  outgrowths of the branchial cavity. Thus, in one of the Symbranchidae, the Indian "Cuchia Eel"
  (<i>Amphipnous cuchia</i>),<a id="NtA_323" href="#Nt_323"><sup>[323]</sup></a> there is a pair of
  small bladder-like sacs, with membranous and vascular walls, each of which opens into the
  branchial cavity above the first gill-cleft, and is supplied with blood by the afferent branchial
  artery of the gill-less first branchial arch. An extreme modification in the same direction <span
  class="pagenum" id="page295"><span class="smaller">{295}</span></span>is presented by the Indian
  Siluroid <i>Saccobranchus</i>.<a id="NtA_324" href="#Nt_324"><sup>[324]</sup></a> In this Fish a
  long caecal diverticulum of the branchial cavity extends backwards on each side from the dorsal
  region of the first branchial cleft to the tail, and in its course is situated internally to the
  lateral trunk musculature, and close to the vertebral column (Fig. 172). The walls of the caeca
  are vascular, but no special respiratory structures are developed within their cavities, which,
  during life, only contain air. In <i>S. singio</i> the right caecum is supplied with blood by an
  extension backwards of the dorsal portion of the first afferent branchial artery of that side; the
  left, on the contrary, being supplied by the corresponding portion of the fourth afferent artery
  of the same side. In <i>S. fossilis</i><a id="NtA_325" href="#Nt_325"><sup>[325]</sup></a> both
  air-sacs are supplied by the fourth afferent branchial artery. The efferent vessels join the

  </div>

  <p>With perhaps one or two exceptions, the accessory respiratory organs of Fishes seem to exist
  for the purpose of enabling their possessors to breathe in air. This is certainly the case with
  the labyrinthiform organs of <i>Anabas</i> and its allies, and also in such Fishes as
  <i>Amphipnous</i>, <i>Saccobranchus</i>, and the Ophiocephalidae, and probably in others. Nearly
  all these Fishes are tropical in geographical distribution, more or less amphibious in their
  habits, and usually possess a remarkable capacity for sustaining life out of water, under
  conditions which are promptly fatal to ordinary Fishes. Thus, <i>Anabas scandens</i> may be kept
  alive for days in earthen pots without water, and when free is able to travel short distances on
  land, especially in the early morning when the dew is on the ground, while <i>Amphipnous</i>
  frequents <span class="pagenum" id="page296"><span class="smaller">{296}</span></span>marshes,
  lurking in holes in the grass and about the sides of ponds. In fact, even when in the water,
  access to air, which is probably swallowed and passed over their accessory breathing organs, is
  indispensable to their existence. Experiments conclusively prove that if the Fish is artificially
  prevented from obtaining air in this way asphyxiation speedily ensues.<a id="NtA_326"
  href="#Nt_326"><sup>[326]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="sp5">In addition to breathing air through the agency of special organs evolved for the
  purpose, there are many freshwater Fishes which, like those just mentioned, periodically rise to
  the surface and swallow air in order to saturate the water which bathes the gills with oxygen.<a

  <p>In the Crossopterygii, Chondrostei, and Holostei, in the Dipnoi, and in the great majority of

  and the kidneys and vertebral column above, a more or less elongated sac with membranous walls, an
  internal epithelial lining and gaseous contents&mdash;the air-bladder (Figs. 154 and 173). Usually
  developed in the embryo as a caecal outgrowth from the dorsal surface of the oesophagus, the
  air-bladder grows anteriorly and posteriorly, and may either retain throughout life its primitive
  connexion with the alimentary canal by means of a longer or shorter tubular canal, the ductus
  pneumaticus, or become completely separated therefrom in the adult by the atrophy of the duct. Its
  walls sometimes, but rarely, contain muscle-fibres, as in <i>Lepidosteus</i>, <i>Amia</i>, and the
  Dipnoi, and are always more or less vascular, while laterally and ventrally the organ is invested
  externally by the peritoneum (Fig. 173). In addition to the muscle-fibres distributed in its
  walls, the bladder is often provided with powerful extrinsic muscles, more especially in those

  is present the air-bladder frequently undergoes remarkable structural modifications and becomes
  adapted for various distinct functions.</p>

  <p>In the Cyclostomata there is no trace of an air-bladder, and, unless represented in certain
  Sharks (e.g. <i>Mustelus</i>, <i>Galeus</i>, and <i>Acanthias</i>),<a id="NtA_328"
  href="#Nt_328"><sup>[328]</sup></a> by a small caecum embedded in the dorsal wall of the
  oesophagus and communicating with its cavity, it is also absent in all Elasmobranchs. In the
  Crossopterygii (e.g. <i>Polypterus</i>),<a id="NtA_329" href="#Nt_329"><sup>[329]</sup></a> the
  air-bladder is double, but while the right sac is long and somewhat tubular, the left is much
  smaller and oval in shape (Fig. 174). Near their anterior extremities the two sacs fuse into a
  single unpaired chamber, beyond which they again project in the form of two short caeca. The
  median chamber opens into the oesophagus on the ventral side by an orifice (<i>gl</i>) bounded by
  prominent lips and furnished with a muscular sphincter. The organ is devoid of internal
  sacculations. In the Chondrostei (e.g. <i>Acipenser</i>) the air-bladder is oval in shape, with a
  smooth, non-sacculated, inner surface, and a lining of ciliated epithelium, and it communicates
  with the oesophagus by means of a relatively wide, dorsally placed, funnel-like orifice.</p>

  <p>In the Lepidosteidae the single air-bladder extends the whole length of the abdominal cavity,
  and, as in <i>Polypterus</i>, communicates with the exterior through a larynx-like vestibule
  provided with a glottis,<a id="NtA_330" href="#Nt_330"><sup>[330]</sup></a> which, however, opens
  dorsally into the oesophagus (Fig. 175). A strong fibrous band runs along the median line of the
  inner surface of its dorsal wall, from which extends ventrally on each side a series of transverse
  fibro-muscular ridges, forming the boundaries of a double row of regularly arranged alveoli (Fig.
  176). The bottom of each alveolus <span class="pagenum" id="page299"><span
  class="smaller">{299}</span></span>is still further sacculated by finer branches of the principal
  fibrous bands.<a id="NtA_331" href="#Nt_331"><sup>[331]</sup></a>  In the Amiidae the bladder is
  very large, and, except that a short median cleft divides it in front into two short caeca, it is
  unpaired.  Internally, its walls are much sacculated, but the alveoli are smaller and arranged
  less regularly than in <i>Lepidosteus</i>. The aperture of communication with the oesophagus is
  dorsally situated.</p>

  <p>It may be mentioned that in all the preceding Teleostomi the ductus pneumaticus is remarkably
  short, the connexion between the air-bladder and the oesophagus being almost direct by means of a
  larger or smaller orifice, which, except in <i>Acipenser</i>, is more anteriorly placed than in
  most other Teleostomi; and further that, unlike many Teleosts, there are no special "retia
  mirabilia," "red bodies," or "red glands."</p>

  <p>In the Dipnoi the structural resemblance of the air-bladder to a true lung, which to some

  <p>In <i>Neoceratodus</i><a id="NtA_332" href="#Nt_332"><sup>[332]</sup></a> the organ is not
  unlike that of <i>Lepidosteus</i>, and takes the form of a spacious unpaired sac, extending from
  one end of the abdominal cavity to the other. On its inner surface two fibrous bands, one of which
  is dorsal and the other ventral, traverse the whole length of the bladder, and project slightly
  into its cavity. <span class="pagenum" id="page300"><span
  class="smaller">{300}</span></span>Between these median ridges extend a number of transverse
  septa, forming the boundaries of a series of pairs of bilaterally symmetrical oval alveoli, the
  walls of which are still further sacculated by a network of finer ridges (Fig. 177). The short

  opens into the oesophagus by a small glottis, situated on the ventral side, a little to the right
  of the median line.</p>

  <p>The more complicated and much more lung-like air-bladder of <i>Protopterus</i> (Fig. 178)<a
  id="NtA_333" href="#Nt_333"><sup>[333]</sup></a> is essentially double, consisting of an anterior
  unpaired portion, and of two sac-like prolongations which extend backwards the whole length of the
  coelom, gradually tapering towards the cloaca. Anteriorly, the unpaired portion of the organ is
  continued into a vestibule or pneumatic duct, which, after passing ventrally on the right side of
  the oesophagus, opens into the latter by a ventrally-situated, slit-like glottis, immediately
  behind the last pair of gill-clefts. The margins of the glottis are provided with
  radially-arranged dilator muscles, and in connexion with its anterior border there is an
  epiglottis-like fibro-cartilaginous plate.<a id="NtA_334" href="#Nt_334"><sup>[334]</sup></a> The
  central cavity of each lung (Figs. 178 and 179) communicates with a series of larger or smaller

  href="#Nt_335"><sup>[335]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In all the Dipnoi the air-bladder is highly vascular, but nevertheless presents no trace of
  "red bodies" or "red glands."</p>

  <p>The most striking features in the remarkably polymorphic air-bladder of Teleosts relate to
  (<i>a</i>) its presence or absence; (<i>b</i>) differences in shape and relative size; (<i>c</i>)
  the development of caecal outgrowths; (<i>d</i>) the subdivision of its cavity by the formation of
  internal septa; (<i>e</i>) the retention or suppression of the ductus pneumaticus, and the
  occasional development of secondary ducts communicating directly with the exterior; (<i>f</i>) the
  presence of "red glands" or "red bodies"; (<i>g</i>) its connexion with the auditory organ;
  (<i>h</i>) its adaptation as an organ for sound-production.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page302"><span class="smaller">{302}</span></span></div>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) The air-bladder is by no means universally present in Teleosts. It is absent in
  several entire families,<a id="NtA_336" href="#Nt_336"><sup>[336]</sup></a> such as, for example,
  the Flat Fishes or Pleuronectidae, the Scopelidae, and the "Lump-suckers" (Cyclopteridae). In a
  few families, as in the Mackerels (Scombridae), the "Blennies" (Blenniidae) and the Polynemidae,
  the organ is present in most genera, but absent in a few, or even present or absent in different
  species of the same genus. Thus, of the three British species of Mackerel, viz. the Spanish
  Mackerel (<i>Scomber colias</i>), <i>S. pneumatophorus</i>, and the common Mackerel (<i>S.
  scombrus</i>), an air-bladder is present in the first two, but absent in the third.<a id="NtA_337"
  href="#Nt_337"><sup>[337]</sup></a></p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) As might be anticipated, the shape of the air-bladder is extremely different in
  various Teleosts, and usually conforms to the shape of the body, while differences in relative
  size are of frequent occurrence, even in closely related species. Sometimes the organ is more or
  less tubular, fusiform, ovoid, or heart-shaped; occasionally it is shaped like a "dumb-bell,"
  consisting of two lateral sacs connected by a median tubular portion, as in the Siluroids
  <i>Clarias</i> and <i>Callichthys</i>; or it may be horse-shoe-shaped, as in the Silurid
  <i>Ailia</i>.<a id="NtA_338" href="#Nt_338"><sup>[338]</sup></a> Not unfrequently a transverse
  constriction divides the air-bladder into two intercommunicating sacs, as in most of the Carp
  family (Cyprinidae), or three such sacs may be formed by two constrictions (e.g. <i>Ophidium</i>).
  In the "Electric Eels" (Gymnotidae) there are two sacs, connected by a slender canal, from which
  the ductus pneumaticus takes its origin.<a id="NtA_339" href="#Nt_339"><sup>[339]</sup></a></p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The air-bladder is either more or less free in the abdominal cavity, or firmly attached to the
  vertebral centra and their rib-bearing processes by fibrous extensions passing between the two
  structures. Not rarely the organ extends from the abdominal <span class="pagenum"
  id="page303"><span class="smaller">{303}</span></span>cavity into the tail, sometimes penetrating
  for a short distance into the expanded haemal canal of the anterior caudal vertebrae, or extending
  unsymmetrically along either the right or left side of the tail. More frequently, perhaps, where
  the air-bladder is prolonged into the tail, it assumes the form of two bilaterally arranged and
  symmetrical caeca, which extend backwards for a variable distance internal to the caudal muscles
  and in contact with the adjacent skeletal elements, as in Notopteridae, and in some Sparidae,
  Carangidae, and Scombridae. The extension of the air-bladder into the tail is often associated
  with a short, laterally-compressed trunk, which, if the bladder is to attain its normal degree of
  development, necessitates its prolongation into the caudal region.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) A characteristic feature in the air-bladder of many Teleosts belonging to widely
  different families is the development of a more or less complex system of simple, or variously
  branched, caecal outgrowths, which, like the internal septa, are specially characteristic of those
  Fishes in which the bladder is used as a vocal organ without, however, being peculiar to them.</p>

  <p>In some of the Gadidae, as in the Cod (<i>Gadus morrhua</i>), the air-bladder divides
  anteriorly into a pair of caecal prolongations which extend forwards to the head, and are often
  curiously coiled. Somewhat similar caeca are also present in species of Berycidae, Sparidae,
  Siluridae, Clupeidae, and Notopteridae. Caecal prolongations may also be developed from the hinder
  end of the bladder, and, as already mentioned, extend into the tail; or even from both ends in the
  same species (e.g. <i>Notopterus</i>).<a id="NtA_340" href="#Nt_340"><sup>[340]</sup></a> In the
  Silurid, <i>Rita crucigera</i>,<a id="NtA_341" href="#Nt_341"><sup>[341]</sup></a> a long tubular
  caecum is developed from each side of the heart-shaped bladder, and thence is prolonged backwards
  to the anus. In certain species of <i>Doras</i> of the same family (e.g. <i>D. maculatus</i>),<a
  id="NtA_342" href="#Nt_342"><sup>[342]</sup></a> an elegant series of variously sized branched
  caeca fringe each of the lateral margins of the bladder. It is, however, in the Physoclist family
  of the Sciaenidae<a id="NtA_343" href="#Nt_343"><sup>[343]</sup></a> that the branching of the
  air-bladder attains its greatest development in extent and variety.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In <i>Otolithus</i> (Fig. 180) two short tubular canals are given off from the antero-lateral
  angles of the bladder, each subsequently dividing into two elongated, tapering sacs, of which one
  is directed forwards and the other backwards. In <i>Corvina lobata</i> (Fig. 181) the lateral
  margins of the bladder are everywhere fringed with a series of tufts of caeca, each tuft being
  connected by a short common canal with the cavity of the organ. In the "Drum" (<i>Pogonias
  chromis</i>) (Fig. 182) each side of the anterior third of the air-bladder has a series of
  digitately branched caecal appendages, the most posterior of which on each side are connected by a
  tubular canal, also bearing branched caeca, with the corresponding postero-lateral extremity of
  the bladder.</p>

  <p><i>Collichthys</i><a id="NtA_344" href="#Nt_344"><sup>[344]</sup></a> has a still more
  remarkable arrangement. In this Sciaenoid (Fig. 183) twenty-five tubular branches are given off
  from each side of the bladder, all of which soon subdivide into a dorsal and a ventral division.
  These still further divide, and their branches either end blindly or are prolonged into a series
  of arches to the mid-dorsal or mid-ventral line as the case may be, where they become continuous
  with the corresponding branches of the opposite side. The series of dorsal branches, enveloped in
  their peritoneal investment, extend between the body of the air-bladder and the roof of the
  body-cavity, while the corresponding ventral branches, similarly invested, surround that part of
  the coelom which contains the stomach, intestine, and liver.</p>

  <i>Erythrinus</i><a id="NtA_346" href="#Nt_346"><sup>[346]</sup></a> is subdivided internally into
  numerous alveoli or sacculi. In <i>Notopterus</i> a longitudinal septum divides the cavity of the
  abdominal portion of the bladder into two lateral chambers, which, however, freely
  intercommunicate anteriorly. In the great majority of the Siluridae<a id="NtA_347"

  <p>(<i>e</i>) In its relations to the oesophagus and to the air-bladder the ductus pneumaticus
  exhibits striking modifications in different Teleosts. With very rare exceptions, an open ductus
  is wanting in the Heteromi, Catosteomi, Acanthopterygii, Opisthomi, Pediculati, Jugulares, and the
  Plectognathi, for which reason the term "Physoclisti" has often been used as a collective name for
  these Fishes. On the other hand, a permanently open ductus is generally present in the
  Malacopterygii, Ostariophysi, Apodes, and the Haplomi, which, in consequence, have been designated
  "Physostomi." It must be emphasised, however, that all Teleosts are Physostomous in the embryonic
  condition, and whether they eventually become Physoclistous or remain Physostomous depends
  entirely on the abortion or retention of the primitive communication between the air-bladder and
  the alimentary canal. When present in Teleosts, the ductus pneumaticus, with a few exceptions
  (e.g. <i>Notopterus</i>), where it is both short and relatively wide, is almost invariably much
  longer and narrower than in the other orders of Teleostomi and in the Dipnoi, sometimes passing
  directly from the air-bladder to the oesophagus, but not infrequently describing a sigmoid curve,
  as in some Cyprinidae, or an even more tortuous course. The opening into the alimentary canal is,
  with perhaps a single exception, dorsal, but may vary from the commencement of the oesophagus to
  the hinder end of the stomach. In <i>Erythrinus</i> the oesophageal aperture is lateral. In two
  instances the air-bladder has acquired secondary openings to the exterior, and of these one occurs
  among the Physostomi and the other <span class="pagenum" id="page307"><span
  class="smaller">{307}</span></span>in the Physoclisti. In the Herring (<i>Clupea harengus</i>),<a
  id="NtA_349" href="#Nt_349"><sup>[349]</sup></a> in addition to the proper ductus, which is
  connected with the distal end of the caecal stomach, a tubular canal leaves the hinder extremity
  of the bladder and opens externally on the left side of the genital aperture; consequently, in
  this Fish the air-bladder has a secondary and direct connexion with the exterior in addition to
  the primary and indirect communication by means of its proper duct. The Horse-Mackerel (<i>Caranx
  trachurus</i>)<a id="NtA_350" href="#Nt_350"><sup>[350]</sup></a> is even more peculiar. This
  Teleost has no true pneumatic duct, but instead a special duct which passes from the bladder to
  open into the right branchial cavity by a very minute aperture. In neither case is anything known
  of the mode of origin or morphological nature of the secondarily acquired duct.</p>

  <p>(<i>f</i>) The air-bladder differs greatly in its degree of vascularity in various Teleosts, as
  well as in the extent to which its capillary blood-vessels accumulate at special points on the
  inner surface to form the so-called "red bodies" or "red glands." In some Teleosts the
  distribution of capillaries is uniform or nearly so; in others, as in the Carp (<i>Cyprinus
  carpio</i>) the vessels are arranged in fan-like, radiating tufts over almost the whole extent of
  the inner surface; in others again, as in the Pike (<i>Esox lucius</i>) the tufts are larger and
  more definitely localised. A more extreme modification occurs in some of the Physostomi, in which
  a remarkable concentration of capillaries takes place at one or more points on the inner surface
  of the bladder, which project into the cavity of the organ in the form of variously shaped
  blood-red masses. These "red bodies" are essentially retia mirabilia, consisting of masses of
  interlacing, tightly-packed capillaries with their afferent arteries and efferent veins. The
  flattened lining epithelium of the bladder is continued over these bodies without undergoing any
  special modification. In the common Eel (<i>Anguilla vulgaris</i>) there are several of these
  bodies, of which the largest are near the entrance of the pneumatic duct.</p>

  <p>In the Physoclisti the "red bodies" seem to be replaced by true glands,<a id="NtA_351"
  href="#Nt_351"><sup>[351]</sup></a> which nevertheless in appearance closely resemble the former.
  Some of the Gadidae, such as the Cod (<i>Gadus <span class="pagenum" id="page308"><span
  class="smaller">{308}</span></span>morrhua</i>), the Haddock (<i>G. aeglefinus</i>), and the Hake
  (<i>Merluccius vulgaris</i>), have a single large "red gland" projecting into the interior of the
  bladder from its dorsal or ventral wall (Fig. 184, A). The John Dory (<i>Zeus faber</i>) has five
  such glands, worm-like and curved in shape, with their concavities facing a central point between
  them (Fig. 184, B). In these Fishes a "rete mirabile" of blood-vessels forms the vascular basis of
  the glands. The ordinary pavement epithelium of the bladder becomes replaced by faintly granular,
  columnar, and evidently glandular cells as it passes over the retia mirabilia, and at the same
  time becomes invaginated into the mass of capillaries in the form of a number of simple caecal
  glands (Fig. 185). So far as is at present known, the "red glands" are only found in those
  Teleosts in which the air-bladder has no ductus pneumaticus, whereas in those Fishes which retain
  the ductus throughout life there are either no special retia mirabilia, or, as in the Eel, only
  the so-called "red bodies."<a id="NtA_352" href="#Nt_352"><sup>[352]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>The Gases of the Air-Bladder.</b>&mdash;The gaseous contents of the air-bladder consist of
  oxygen and nitrogen, but the relative proportions of the two gases differ in different Fishes, and
  even in the same Fish, under different conditions. Normally the proportion of oxygen is
  considerably less in freshwater than in marine Fishes, and amongst the latter the proportion of
  oxygen is often enormously greater, amounting in some cases to 87 per cent., in deep-sea species
  as compared with their shallow water congeners. A trace of carbon dioxide is also usually present.
  The gases are derived from the blood as the latter circulates through the capillaries in the walls
  of the bladder, and it is highly probable that the "red glands" take an important part in the
  process; at all events, experimental research has shown that the "secretion" or diffusion of gas
  into the air-bladder, as well as the absorption of gas from the bladder into the blood, take place
  most rapidly in those Fishes in which "red glands" or "red bodies" are present.<a id="NtA_354"

  <p><b>The Functions of the Air-Bladder.</b>&mdash;Probably no single organ in any group of
  Vertebrata is associated with the performance of a greater variety of functions than the
  air-bladder of Fishes. Originally evolved, it may be, as a glandular caecum in certain <span
  class="pagenum" id="page310"><span class="smaller">{310}</span></span>Sharks, the air-bladder in
  the Dipnoi, and some of the more generalised Teleostomi (e.g. <i>Amia</i> and <i>Lepidosteus</i>),
  and perhaps also in a few of the more specialised members of the latter group (<i>e.g.</i> certain
  Teleosts), is to a greater or less extent an accessory respiratory organ. In not a few Teleosts it
  is an organ for sound-production, and in others again it is sometimes regarded as having an
  important relation to the sense of hearing. But omitting such subordinate functions which, as it
  were, have been grafted on to the air-bladder, there can be no doubt that in the great majority of
  Fishes its primary use is to act as a hydrostatic organ or "float." From this point of view
  experimental investigations<a id="NtA_355" href="#Nt_355"><sup>[355]</sup></a> seem to justify the
  following conclusions<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The function of the air-bladder is to render the Fish, bulk for bulk, of the same weight as the
  water in which it lives. In this condition of equilibrium, or plane of least effort, the Fish
  floats <i>in</i> the water, and therefore it is able to swim with a minimum of muscular effort. It
  is obvious, however, that as a Fish rises or sinks it becomes exposed to an increase or a
  diminution of hydrostatic pressure, which will necessarily bring about the expansion or
  contraction of the volume of gas in the air-bladder, and, therefore, by decreasing or increasing
  the specific gravity of the animal, will tend to remove the Fish from its plane of least effort.
  To counteract this, and to restore the Fish to a plane of equilibrium at the new level, gas is
  either absorbed from the air-bladder, or more gas is secreted into the bladder, as the case may
  be. According to Moreau, by this process of automatic adjustment a Fish will always find, sooner
  or later, a plane of least effort, whatever may be its depth in the water; and further, this
  process takes place much more readily in those Fishes which possess "red glands" or "red bodies",
  and with extreme slowness in those in which these organs are absent. Nevertheless, it seems
  doubtful if this process of adjustment can be of much use to a Fish in ordinary vertical
  movements, inasmuch as gaseous secretion and absorption are comparatively slow processes, the
  length of which in different Fishes, and under different conditions, varies from a few hours to
  several days. On the whole it seems more probable that adjustment to the varying pressures of
  different depths by such means is far more likely to be useful during such slow and gradual
  changes of level as are encountered <span class="pagenum" id="page311"><span
  class="smaller">{311}</span></span>in the course of diurnal, seasonal, or other periodic
  migrations than during the rapid changes of level which may take place in ordinary vertical
  locomotion.<a id="NtA_356" href="#Nt_356"><sup>[356]</sup></a> In the generality of Fishes, and
  more especially in the Physoclisti, it may be concluded that the possession of an air-bladder
  restricts freedom of movement in the vertical direction, and confines ordinary locomotion within
  more or less well-defined vertical limits above or below the plane of least effort for the time
  being. As illustrating this point, and as a proof of the danger incurred by a too rapid rise in
  the water, the following remarks with reference to the "Kilch," a small Salmonoid
  (<i>Coregonus</i>) inhabiting the Lake of Constance, and a favourite article of food, may be
  quoted:<a id="NtA_357" href="#Nt_357"><sup>[357]</sup></a>&mdash;The Fish "are caught in nets, and
  brought to the surface of the water; they come up invariably with the belly much distended, the
  air in the swimming-bladder, being relieved from the pressure of the column of water, has expanded
  greatly and occasioned this unnatural distension, which renders the Fish quite incapable of
  swimming. Under these conditions the Fish is naturally unable to live for any length of time. But
  the fishermen of the lake have a very simple remedy; they prick into the air-bladder with a fine
  needle; the air escapes with some force, the distension subsides, and the fishes are enabled to
  live under totally changed conditions as to pressure, even in quite shallow water and at the
  surface, swimming quite as freely as their companions, the natives of the surface water. Hence the
  Kilch is confined to a certain depth, because it is not capable of accommodating the tension of
  its swimming-bladder to the change of pressure in the column of superincumbent water."</p>

  <p>It is not improbable that the Physostomi, or at any rate most of them, are somewhat more
  advantageously placed in this respect. From the general absence of "red glands" in this group, it
  may be inferred that whatever capacity for gaseous secretion or absorption they possess must be
  exercised with exceptional slowness, and, therefore, as a means of pressure-adjustment may be
  neglected. On the other hand, they seem to possess the compensating advantage of being able to
  substitute for absorption the mechanical liberation of gas through the ductus pneumaticus. It
  would seem, therefore, that the Physostomi have a distinct advantage over the Physoclisti in that
  during ascent in the water they <span class="pagenum" id="page312"><span
  class="smaller">{312}</span></span>can more readily adapt themselves to the diminished pressure of
  a higher level by ejecting the needful amount of gas than by relying upon the process of gaseous
  absorption.<a id="NtA_358" href="#Nt_358"><sup>[358]</sup></a> This conclusion is in harmony with
  the results of experiment and with much that is known of the habits of these Fishes and their
  greater freedom of locomotion in the vertical direction.</p>

  <p>These briefly summarised conclusions as to the hydrostatic function of the air-bladder must,
  however, be accepted only in a general sense. There are many structural anomalies in the
  air-bladder of Fishes which are very difficult to explain, or to correlate with any variations in
  the habits or in the locomotor activities of its possessor.</p>

  <p class="sp5">In this connexion it may be mentioned that the presence or absence of an
  air-bladder in different Fishes seems to some extent to be governed by two causes. First, whenever
  the requirements of a Fish necessitate exceptional freedom of locomotion in all directions the
  restrictions imposed by the presence of an air-bladder are removed by its partial or complete
  suppression; a result produced, secondly, by the assumption of a bottom feeding or ground habit on
  the part of the Fish. Fishes like the Flat Fishes or Pleuronectidae, when not in motion by the
  exercise of their fins, habitually rest on the sea-bottom, and, as an air-bladder is useless under
  such conditions, it has, in consequence, undergone complete atrophy. Not a few Siluridae, and some
  Cyprinidae, inhabit the comparatively shallow waters of rapidly flowing mountain torrents, and are
  often provided with suckers for attachment to stones or rocks. To such Fishes as these a
  hydrostatic organ is obviously useless, and it has hence become greatly reduced in size, and in
  other respects approaches the condition of a vestigial organ.</p>

  <h3 class="ac" title="Chapter XII. Vascular system" style="margin-bottom:3.4ex;"><span
  class="larger">CHAPTER XII</span></h3>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="smaller">THE VASCULAR SYSTEM, THE
  LYMPHATICS, AND THE BLOOD-GLANDS</span></p>

  <p>The Cyclostomata and Fishes possess a closed vascular system, consisting of a heart, arteries,
  capillaries, and veins, the whole forming a continuous series of blood-containing channels
  provided with definite limiting walls, through which the blood is propelled in a constant
  direction by the rhythmical contractions of the heart. In the course of the circulation the blood
  flows from the heart through a single large trunk, the ventral aorta, to the capillaries of the
  gills. From the gills the arterialised blood is collected into a large dorsally-situated vessel,
  the dorsal aorta, and thence is distributed through a system of arteries to the capillaries of the
  various organs of the body. Finally, the blood is collected from the capillaries and returned to
  the heart by the veins.</p>

  <p>Although in most instances the organs of the body are supplied with arterialised blood conveyed
  to them by arteries, there are nevertheless cases in which an organ may receive venous blood by a
  vein in addition to arterial blood supplied by an artery. For example, the capillaries of the
  liver not only receive blood from the hepatic artery, but also venous blood by a large vein
  (hepatic portal vein), formed by the union of a number of smaller veins by which venous blood is
  collected from the capillaries of the stomach, intestine, spleen, and pancreas. In this and
  similar instances, where a vein formed by the union of the capillaries of an organ, or of a series
  of organs, instead of uniting with other veins and proceeding towards the heart, becomes
  continuous with a second set of capillaries in some other organ, a "portal" system is said to be
  formed, and in the particular example of the liver it is termed the "hepatic portal" system. A
  similar, or "renal <span class="pagenum" id="page314"><span
  class="smaller">{314}</span></span>portal," system also exists in connexion with the kidneys in
  the majority of Fishes.</p>

  <p>There is little doubt that, primarily, the vascular system of Vertebrate animals consisted of a
  dorsal artery (dorsal aorta), running along the median dorsal line of the alimentary canal, and a
  ventral or subintestinal vein similarly related to the ventral surface of the digestive tube. The
  two vessels were connected by a series of pairs of lateral branches, which had their origins from
  the dorsal vessel, and, by their subdivision, formed a capillary network in the walls of the
  alimentary canal. From these networks paired veins issued and opened into the subintestinal vein.
  The simplicity of this primitive arrangement was somewhat disturbed in the region of the pharynx
  by the development of gill-clefts, in the walls of which the blood circulated for respiratory
  purposes from the ventral to the dorsal vessel; and also by the development of a hepatic portal
  circulation in connexion with the liver. In the latter instance the subintestinal vein entered the
  liver and subdivided into capillaries in the substance of that organ, the corresponding efferent
  vessel, or hepatic vein, becoming continuous with the anterior or pharyngeal section of the
  subintestinal vein, or, as it is usually termed, the ventral aorta. In this low grade of vascular
  system, which is perhaps most completely retained in Amphioxus, the circulation of the blood was
  probably effected by the wave-like contractions of more or fewer of the larger vessels; but
  subsequently a definite chambered heart was developed at the origin of the ventral aorta.</p>

  <p>Of Fishes in general it may be said that the primitive dorsal and ventral vessels are present
  in the embryo, and for a time retain their original relations and physiological importance. To a
  very unequal extent they may also be retained in the adult, where, however, they co-exist with
  numerous other vessels, which the increasing differentiation of the body has called into
  existence. Thus, at a later period of embryonic life, the subintestinal vein becomes somewhat
  fragmentary. Its caudal section (caudal vein) ceases to be continuous with the precaudal portion,
  and the blood collected from the muscles and other structures of the tail is conveyed to the heart
  by a pair of posterior cardinal veins, which are either directly continuous with the caudal vein,
  or indirectly through the intervention of a renal portal system in the kidneys. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page315"><span class="smaller">{315}</span></span>The precaudal portion of the
  subintestinal vein is represented by a vein which runs forwards in the intestinal wall, and is one
  of the minor affluents of the hepatic portal vein, while its prehepatic section is represented in
  succession by the hepatic vein, the heart, and the ventral aorta. Of the additional veins which
  supplement these remnants of a primitively continuous subintestinal vein, the largest and most
  constant are (<i>a</i>) the posterior cardinal veins which, commencing in the kidneys and
  receiving the blood from those organs, pass forwards to the heart; (<i>b</i>) a pair of anterior
  cardinal veins, formed by the union of smaller veins from the head, including the brain, and
  passing backwards towards the heart. At the level of the latter organ each anterior cardinal vein
  joins the posterior cardinal of the same side of the body to form a short but wide transverse
  vessel, the Cuvierian duct or precaval vein, which opens into the hindermost of the cavities of
  the heart, viz. the sinus venosus; (<i>c</i>) a pair of inferior jugular veins by which the
  nutrient blood of the branchial apparatus is returned to the right and left Cuvierian ducts. In
  addition to these principal veins there may also be a pair of lateral veins collecting the blood
  from the lateral walls of the trunk, and also opening into the Cuvierian ducts; and subclavian and
  femoral veins from the pectoral and pelvic fins.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the primitive dorsal vessel (dorsal aorta), retains not only its original
  position and relations, but also its primary function as the main channel for the distribution of
  arterialised blood to all parts of the body. The system of lateral and probably segmentally
  arranged vessels, by which the dorsal and subintestinal vessels were connected in the primitive
  Vertebrata, have undergone considerable modification in all existing Fishes, but nevertheless
  retain much of their original disposition and relations in the pharyngeal region of the alimentary
  canal, where they are represented by the afferent and efferent vessels of the gills.</p>

  <p>A more detailed account of the condition of the vascular system in the Cyclostomata and Fishes
  will now be given.</p>

  <p><b>The Venous System.</b>&mdash;The Cyclostomata,<a id="NtA_359"
  href="#Nt_359"><sup>[359]</sup></a> as might be expected, exhibit a more primitive condition of
  the venous system <span class="pagenum" id="page316"><span class="smaller">{316}</span></span>in
  certain features than is the case in any other group. The precaudal portion of the subintestinal
  vein retains much of its original importance and runs in the rudimentary intestinal spiral valve
  as far as the liver, where it becomes the hepatic portal vein. From the liver the blood is
  collected into a <i>single</i> hepatic vein, and by it is conveyed to the sinus venosus. The
  caudal section of the subintestinal vein, now known as the caudal vein, bifurcates near the anus,
  and its two branches become directly continuous with the right and left posterior cardinals,
  without forming a renal portal system. In their forward course to the heart the posterior
  cardinals are situated directly beneath the notochord, and after receiving the blood from the
  kidneys and gonads, and from the numerous pairs of segmental veins of the body-wall, join the
  corresponding anterior cardinal veins, and form on each side a short transverse Cuvierian duct
  which opens into the sinus venosus. There is also a pair of inferior jugular veins which, however,
  unite opposite the fifth pair of gill-sacs to form a single trunk; this vessel is continued
  backwards, externally to the medio-ventral cartilage of the branchial basket, and finally opens
  directly into the sinus venosus.</p>

  <p>In Elasmobranchs (e.g. <i>Mustelus antarcticus</i>)<a id="NtA_360"
  href="#Nt_360"><sup>[360]</sup></a> the caudal vein (Fig. 186) lies in the haemal canal of the
  caudal portion of the vertebral column. On reaching the kidneys the vein divides into two renal
  portal veins, which, however, are not directly continuous with the posterior cardinal veins as in
  the Cyclostomata, but, on the contrary, after receiving the posterior segmental and oviducal
  veins, become continuous with the capillaries of the kidneys.</p>

  <p>From the latter organs the blood is collected by a series of renal veins, and by them conveyed
  to the posterior cardinals, and thence to the Cuvierian ducts. In the adult, therefore, there is a
  well-developed renal portal system, but it is worthy of note, nevertheless, that this system is
  developed comparatively late in embryonic life, and that at an earlier stage the caudal vein is
  directly continuous with the two posterior cardinals, precisely as is the case in the Cyclostomata
  throughout life. The posterior cardinal veins are situated in the dorsal wall of the coelom (Fig.
  187), beneath the vertebral column. For the hinder portion of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page317"><span class="smaller">{317}</span></span>their extent they are embedded in the
  kidneys (Fig. 186); and in this region the two veins are in close relation in the median line, and
  here and there freely communicate with each other. More anteriorly, they enlarge so much that they
  present the appearance of cavernous sinuses. In addition to the anterior segmental and oviducal
  veins, the posterior cardinals receive the spermatic or the ovarian vein from the male or female
  gonad.</p>

  <p>The precaudal section of the primitive subintestinal vein, now termed the internal intestinal
  vein (Figs. 186 and 187), traverses the spiral valve as it passes forwards to the liver, but from
  a physiological point of view is now merely one of the factors of the great hepatic portal vein,
  the principal tributaries of which are the veins from the stomach and intestine, including the
  rectal gland, and the pancreas and spleen. On entering the liver the hepatic portal vein divides
  into two principal branches for the right and left halves of the gland. From the liver the blood
  is conveyed by two hepatic veins to the sinus venosus.</p>

  <p>The anterior cardinal vein is situated directly above the gill-arches of its side of the head,
  and extends forwards from its junction behind with the Cuvierian duct to the outer side of the
  auditory capsule, where it communicates by a valvular orifice with a large sinus surrounding the
  eye-muscles (orbital sinus), and ventrally, by means of a similar aperture, with another large
  sinus, the hyoidean sinus, which lies on the outer face of the corresponding hyoid arch, and is
  continuous ventrally with its fellow of the opposite side. Into the orbital sinus open the
  anterior facial vein from the anterior and external regions of the head, and the anterior cerebral
  vein from the lateral half of the brain, and, into the hyoidean sinus, the nutrient veins from the
  hyoidean hemibranch.</p>

  <p>The inferior jugular veins are situated beneath the branchial apparatus.  Each vein begins
  anteriorly by communicating with <span class="pagenum" id="page319"><span
  class="smaller">{319}</span></span>the hyoidean sinus of its side, and, after receiving the
  nutrient veins from the holobranchs of the first four branchial arches, opens into the
  corresponding Cuvierian duct.</p>

  <p>The venous blood from the heart itself is collected into two coronary veins, which open into
  the sinus venosus.</p>

  <p>In addition to the more important veins already described, there is also a series of median and
  lateral cutaneous veins communicating at different points with certain of the more deeply seated
  veins (Fig. 187).</p>

  <p>Characteristic features in the venous system of <i>Mustelus</i>, as also of Elasmobranchs in
  general, are the development of transverse connexions between certain of the principal paired
  veins, and the tendency of many of the main veins to enlarge into more or less irregularly-shaped
  sinuses.</p>

  <p>In its broad outlines the venous system of the Teleostomi agrees with that of Elasmobranchs,
  but is nevertheless characterised by several more or less important modifications, while at the
  same time exhibiting many differences in minor details.</p>

  <p>A renal portal system is usually present, but is singularly variable in the source of its
  tributary veins, even in closely allied forms.<a id="NtA_362" href="#Nt_362"><sup>[362]</sup></a>
  In the Sturgeon (<i>Acipenser</i>) and in some Teleosts, as in the Siluroid, <i>Amiurus catus</i>,
  it resembles that of Elasmobranchs. In other Teleosts, on the contrary, the renal portal system
  presents various grades of degeneration, or, possibly, of imperfect evolution, as will be seen
  from the following illustrations of its condition in different genera.</p>

  <p>In <i>Amiurus</i> the caudal vein, after giving off right and left renal portal veins to the
  renal capillaries, emerges from the ventral surface of the kidneys, and is then continued forwards
  between the gonads, the veins from which it receives, as the radicle of the hepatic portal
  vein.</p>

  <p>In the Eel (<i>Anguilla vulgaris</i>) the caudal vein (Fig. 188) traverses the fused hinder
  portions of the kidneys, receiving several segmental veins from the body-wall and also giving off
  from each side numerous renal portal branches. More anteriorly, where the two kidneys become
  distinct, the caudal vein also divides into two renal portal veins and, as each vein extends <span
  class="pagenum" id="page320"><span class="smaller">{320}</span></span>forwards along the outer
  border of the kidney of its side, it receives a number of segmental veins, and, at the same time,
  gives off branches to the renal capillaries. In addition, each renal portal vein is connected with
  the hepatic portal vein by a series of singular arch-like vessels into which the ovarian or
  spermatic veins open.</p>

  <p>It is obvious, therefore, that in both <i>Amiurus</i> and <i>Anguilla</i> the primitive direct
  continuity of the caudal and posterior cardinal veins has been interrupted by the formation of a
  well-developed renal portal system, and further, that the residue of the caudal venous blood finds
  its way to the liver through the hepatic portal vein; hence it follows that, as in so many of the
  lower air-breathing Vertebrates, the whole of the venous blood from the tail is distributed either
  to the kidneys or liver in the course of its return journey to the heart.</p>

  <p>The Tench (<i>Tinca vulgaris</i>) exhibits the interesting anomaly of possessing two caudal
  veins, a dorsal and a ventral (Fig. 189). The dorsal vein is directly continuous with the right
  posterior cardinal, while the ventral one divides into three branches, two forming right and left
  renal portal veins and receiving numerous segmental veins, and the third becoming one of the
  affluents of the hepatic portal vein. In this Teleost it is clear that a portion of the caudal
  blood passes directly to the heart through the right posterior cardinal without traversing either
  the renal portal or hepatic portal system.</p>

  <p>In the Cod (<i>Gadus morrhua</i>) the caudal vein divides into two branches.  The larger right
  vein retains its direct continuity <span class="pagenum" id="page321"><span
  class="smaller">{321}</span></span>with the corresponding posterior cardinal; the left, on the
  contrary, has ceased to be continuous with the greatly reduced left posterior cardinal and forms a
  renal portal vein, the distribution of which is, however, restricted to the hinder portion of the
  left kidney (Fig. 190). As in <i>Amiurus</i>, a branch of the caudal vein forms one of the
  tributaries of the hepatic portal vein. In the Cod it would therefore seem that only a relatively
  small proportion of the caudal blood flows through the imperfectly developed renal portal system,
  the bulk of it traversing the right posterior cardinal and passing directly to the heart, leaving,
  nevertheless, a modicum for transmission to the liver. Finally, it may be mentioned that in some
  Teleosts the caudal vein retains its embryonic continuity with one, usually the right, posterior
  cardinal, without giving off a renal portal affluent, as in the Perch (<i>Perca fluviatilis</i>);
  or, after division, with both posterior cardinals, as in the Lump-sucker (<i>Cyclopterus
  lumpus</i>). In such instances as these no portion of the caudal blood traverses the kidneys, and
  if a renal portal system exists at all, the only true renal portal veins are the adjacent
  segmental veins, which transmit venous blood directly to the kidneys, instead of first uniting
  with renal portal branches of the caudal vein as in the Tench and the Eel.</p>

  <p>Whatever may be the condition of the renal portal system, all the renal blood is eventually
  collected by renal veins and conveyed to the posterior cardinals, which are often connected by one
  or <span class="pagenum" id="page322"><span class="smaller">{322}</span></span>by several
  transverse anastomoses (Fig. 190). In the region of the heart each posterior cardinal joins the
  corresponding anterior cardinal to form a short but wide Cuvierian duct, which finally opens into
  the sinus venosus.</p>

  <p>A subintestinal vein is present in the embryo (e.g. <i>Lepidosteus</i>, <i>Acipenser</i>, and
  some Teleosts),<a id="NtA_363" href="#Nt_363"><sup>[363]</sup></a> but in the adult Teleostome its

  as one of the minor tributaries of the hepatic portal vein.<a id="NtA_364"
  href="#Nt_364"><sup>[364]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The hepatic portal vein is formed as in Elasmobranchs, but in different Teleostomi it may also
  receive the veins from the pyloric caeca, from a portion of the air-bladder, the gonads, and, as
  previously mentioned, a tributary from the caudal vein. There are usually two hepatic veins
  opening into the sinus venosus, and generally of equal size (Fig. 190).</p>

  more or fewer of them, especially those from the dorsal wall of the organ, open into the posterior
  cardinals. They may, as in <i>Polypterus</i>, even join the hepatic veins.<a id="NtA_365"
  href="#Nt_365"><sup>[365]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The veins from the gonads are very variable in their destination, sometimes joining the
  posterior cardinals, as in the Salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>); or the hepatic portal vein, as in
  <i>Amiurus</i>; or, as in the Perch (<i>Perca fluviatilis</i>), forming by their union a single
  trunk, which communicates directly with the left Cuvierian duct.</p>

  <p>Representatives of the great lateral veins of Elasmobranchs appear to be absent in the
  Teleostomi, the veins from the pectoral and pelvic limbs joining the Cuvierian duct and the
  posterior cardinal veins respectively.</p>

  <p>The two large anterior cardinal veins, which collect the blood from the head and brain, occupy
  their usual position directly above the branchial apparatus, and are sometimes connected by
  transverse anastomoses as they pass backwards to join the Cuvierian ducts. The inferior jugular
  vein is either single (e.g. <i>Gadus</i>); or paired, as in <i>Perca</i> (Fig. 190).</p>

  <p>In the Dipnoi the venous system is distinguished by an interesting combination of characters,
  some of which are either primitive or peculiar to the group, while others exhibit a distinct
  transition to the embryonic or the adult condition of the lower air-breathing Vertebrates.</p>

  <p>In <i>Neoceratodus</i><a id="NtA_366" href="#Nt_366"><sup>[366]</sup></a> (Fig. 191) the renal
  portal system is unusually complex, the veins distributing venous blood to the kidneys being
  derived from several sources, as follows: (1) from each of the two branches into which the caudal
  vein divides on its exit from the haemal canal (<i>af.r.v</i>); (2) from a common trunk
  (<i>pt.v</i>) which, on each side, is formed by the union of segmental veins from certain of the
  post-cloacal myotomes and is united with its fellow by a transverse anastomosis; (3) from more
  anteriorly situated intercostal or segmental veins (<i>i.c.v</i>) which enter each kidney
  directly; and (4) from a vein on each side corresponding to the renal portal vein of Amphibia. The
  latter vein (<i>rp.v</i>) is formed by one of the two branches of the iliac or femoral vein, and
  joins <span class="pagenum" id="page324"><span class="smaller">{324}</span></span>the
  corresponding vein from the caudal myotomes; from the common trunk numerous branches enter the

  </div>

  <p>In the derivation of renal portal veins from each of the two veins into which the caudal vein
  divides, <i>Neoceratodus</i> approaches the Elasmobranchs. On the other hand, the utilisation of
  ordinary segmental veins from the caudal and pre-caudal myotomes, some of which directly enter the
  kidney, is a feature which has already been remarked in some Teleosts; while the formation of a
  renal portal affluent by a branch of the femoral vein is an even more striking Amphibian
  characteristic.</p>

  <p>The efferent renal veins<a id="NtA_367" href="#Nt_367"><sup>[367]</sup></a> join the root of
  the left posterior cardinal and the adjacent portion of the caudal vein.</p>

  <p>Of the two great venous trunks into which the caudal vein divides, the right is much the larger
  and behaves somewhat differently to the left. The former (<i>i.v.c</i>) passes forwards in
  relation with the right kidney, receiving in its course the spermatic or ovarian veins from the
  gonad of its side, and then traverses the liver, finally opening into the median portion of the
  sinus venosus, between the orifices of the two hepatic veins. The left branch of the caudal vein
  (<i>l.p.c</i>) also passes forwards in relation with the left <span class="pagenum"
  id="page325"><span class="smaller">{325}</span></span>kidney and receives veins from the
  corresponding gonad; but, instead of traversing the liver, it passes above that organ, and finally
  opens into the left Cuvierian duct. The course of the left vein, and the relations of the vessel
  to the caudal vein and the left Cuvierian duct, point to the conclusion that it represents the
  left posterior cardinal of other Fishes. From its continuity with the caudal vein it is also
  obvious that the hinder or renal portion of the right trunk is a remnant of the right posterior
  cardinal; but the more anterior section so closely resembles the postcaval vein, or inferior vena
  cava of the higher Vertebrates, in its relations to the liver, the hepatic veins, and the sinus
  venosus, that its identity as such seems beyond doubt, and this interpretation is supported by
  well-known observations<a id="NtA_368" href="#Nt_368"><sup>[368]</sup></a> on the mode of origin
  of the inferior vena cava in Amphibia, and especially the union of the independently formed
  inferior vena cava with the posterior or inter-renal portion of the embryonic right posterior
  cardinal vein, combined with the atrophy of the anterior portion of the latter vein.<a
  id="NtA_369" href="#Nt_369"><sup>[369]</sup></a> The singular connexions and relations of these
  two great veins afford an additional illustration of the significant transitional condition of the
  venous system in the Dipnoi. On the other hand, the direct continuity of the caudal vein with
  vessels which, wholly or in part, represent the two posterior cardinals, is a feature alike
  characteristic of the adult Cyclostome and the embryonic Elasmobranch, Teleost, and Amphibian.</p>

  <p>As in the Cyclostomes and Elasmobranchs, the precaudal section of the embryonic subintestinal
  vein is represented in the adult by an intra-intestinal vein which traverses the spiral valve near
  its free edge and is a tributary of the hepatic portal vein.</p>

  <p>The two veins from the undivided air-bladder unite to form a single vessel, which, instead of
  joining the hepatic portal or posterior cardinal veins as in other Fishes, opens into the left
  auricle, like the pulmonary veins of the Amphibia.</p>

  <p>A further resemblance to the Amphibia is to be found in the presence of an anterior abdominal
  vein. After leaving the pelvic <span class="pagenum" id="page326"><span
  class="smaller">{326}</span></span>limb each femoral vein divides into two branches; one of these
  forms a renal portal vein as previously described; the other, which may rightly be termed a pelvic
  vein (<i>pv.v</i>), unites with its fellow to form a median anterior abdominal vein (<i>a.ab</i>).
  Pursuing its course forwards in the ventral abdominal wall, the vein eventually reaches the heart
  and opens into the sinus venosus. The direct connexion of the anterior abdominal vein with the
  heart is yet another example of the retention in the adult <i>Neoceratodus</i> of a transitory
  embryonic feature in the developing Amphibian.<a id="NtA_370"

  <p>As in other Fishes, the blood from the head is conveyed to the Cuvierian ducts by an anterior
  cardinal and an inferior jugular on each side. There are no lateral veins, the blood from the
  pelvic fins flowing into the renal portal system or into the anterior abdominal vein, and that
  from the pectoral fin through subscapular and brachial veins into the Cuvierian ducts. Lateral
  cutaneous veins are, however, present; and, as in Elasmobranchs (e.g. <i>Mustelus
  antarcticus</i>), anastomose anteriorly with the subscapular vein and behind with the caudal
  vein.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page327"><span class="smaller">{327}</span></span></div>

  <p>Less is known of the venous system of <i>Protopterus</i>,<a id="NtA_371"
  href="#Nt_371"><sup>[371]</sup></a> but it is certain, nevertheless, that it presents a more
  advanced grade of evolution than in <i>Neoceratodus</i>, and, except for the doubt as to the
  existence of an anterior abdominal vein, it is essentially similar to that of a Urodele Amphibian
  in which the right posterior cardinal vein has aborted.</p>

  <p>The caudal vein (Fig. 192) divides into right and left renal portal branches, neither of which,
  however, is directly continuous with the inferior vena cava or the left posterior cardinal; on the
  contrary, each renal portal vein is joined by the corresponding iliac or femoral vein, and also by
  numerous segmental veins, and then distributes the whole of its venous blood to the kidney. The
  radicles of the inferior vena cava and the left posterior cardinal are formed by the renal veins
  from the two kidneys, and in their forward course to the heart both veins receive in addition
  genital and segmental veins. In its course through the liver the inferior vena cava receives
  several hepatic veins, and finally opens into the sinus venosus, while the left posterior cardinal
  vein joins the corresponding Cuvierian duct, which also receives anterior cardinal, inferior
  jugular, and subclavian veins. There is an intra-intestinal vein as in <i>Neoceratodus</i>, but an
  anterior abdominal vein has yet to be discovered. The two pulmonary veins from the double
  air-bladder form a single trunk before communicating with the left auricle.</p>

  <p>With the exception of certain doubtful details which need further investigation, the venous
  system of <i>Lepidosiren</i><a id="NtA_372" href="#Nt_372"><sup>[372]</sup></a> seems to resemble
  that of <i>Protopterus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>The Heart.</b>&mdash;The heart is more anteriorly placed than in other Vertebrates, being
  situated directly behind and beneath the last pair of branchial clefts and internal to the ventral
  portion of the pectoral girdle. The organ is enclosed in a pericardial cavity, which, in the
  adult, is separated from the abdominal portion of the coelom by a transverse pericardio-peritoneal
  septum, and in the Lamprey (<i>Petromyzon</i>) is partially enclosed within a cartilaginous,
  cup-like modification of the hinder part of the branchial basket. In the Ammocoetes-stage of the
  Lamprey the pericardium is in communication behind with the general coelom, but the connexion is
  lost in the adult. In Elasmobranchs the <span class="pagenum" id="page328"><span
  class="smaller">{328}</span></span>two cavities are connected by a single pericardio-peritoneal
  canal, or by two such canals; and in <i>Chimaera</i>, and in the Sturgeon (<i>Acipenser</i>) and
  <i>Polyodon</i>, by a single canal.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The heart consists of at least three chambers, a sinus venosus which receives the venous blood
  from the body, an auricle and a ventricle, to which is added a conus arteriosus in the
  Elasmobranchs, certain Teleostomi (Crossopterygii, Chondrostei, and Holostei), and in the Dipnoi.
  Through these cardiac chambers the blood is forced in the order mentioned. In the Dipnoi the
  auricle is subdivided by a more or less complete interauricular septum into a right and left
  auricle,<a id="NtA_373" href="#Nt_373"><sup>[373]</sup></a> the former receiving the venous blood
  from the sinus venosus, and the latter the aerated blood from the lung-like air-bladder.</p>

  <p>The sinus venosus and the auricle have very thin walls; the ventricular walls, on the contrary,
  are very thick and in great measure are composed of a sponge-like network of muscular bundles
  which generally encroaches considerably on the ventricular cavity. Membranous valves, the
  sinu-auricular, and the auriculo-ventricular valves, are developed at the junctions of the sinus
  venosus with the auricle, and the auricle with the ventricle respectively. The conus arteriosus is
  muscular and contractile, and is interposed between the ventricle and the root of the ventral
  aorta. Internally, the conus is provided with several transverse rows of pocket-shaped or
  semilunar valves. In Teleosts the conus is non-muscular and vestigial, and has but a single row of
  valves, corresponding to the most anterior of the multiple rows of valves in the Elasmobranchs. In
  these <span class="pagenum" id="page329"><span class="smaller">{329}</span></span>Fishes the
  vestigial conus is succeeded by a non-contractile, bulb-like dilatation, or bulbus aortae, of the
  root of the ventral aorta. In only a single Teleost, viz. <i>Albula</i>, one of the Albulidae, is
  the vestigial conus muscular, and at the same time provided with two rows of valves.<a
  id="NtA_374" href="#Nt_374"><sup>[374]</sup></a> In the Cyclostomata there is a bulbus with a
  single row of two valves, but no true conus.</p>

  <p>In the Dipnoi (e.g. <i>Protopterus</i>) the heart, like the rest of the vascular system,
  exhibits certain interesting resemblances to the Amphibian heart. In addition to a more or less
  complete interauricular septum separating right and left auricles, there is a median longitudinal
  ridge, partly muscular and partly fibrous, which incompletely subdivides the cavity of the
  ventricle. The spirally-twisted conus arteriosus is furnished with several transverse rows of
  valves, certain of which coalesce longitudinally to form a complete septum dividing the cavity of
  the conus into two distinct lateral channels: with this septum there coalesces another septum,
  which cuts off the origins of the anterior two pairs from the remaining afferent branchial
  arteries. The formation of these septa has the physiological effect of subdividing the series of
  cardiac cavities into two parallel channels, of which one has its origin behind in the sinus
  venosus and transmits venous blood to the posterior afferent branchial vessels; while the other,
  commencing with the left auricle, conveys arterial blood to the first two pairs of afferent
  branchial arteries.<a id="NtA_375" href="#Nt_375"><sup>[375]</sup></a> In <i>Neoceratodus</i>,
  however, the longitudinal septum in the conus is incomplete, and hence the blood which is sent to
  the anterior afferent vessels is mixed.<a id="NtA_376" href="#Nt_376"><sup>[376]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>The Arterial System.</b>&mdash;The ventral aorta is a median artery situated beneath the
  floor of the pharynx, and having its origin, behind, either directly from the ventricle or from
  the conus arteriosus.</p>

  <p>In the Cyclostomata<a id="NtA_377" href="#Nt_377"><sup>[377]</sup></a> (e.g. <i>Petromyzon</i>)
  the ventral aorta (Fig. 194) is continued forwards from the heart as a single vessel to the fourth
  pair of gill-sacs, where it divides into right and left branches which extend as far as the
  anterior walls of the first pair of gill-sacs. Eight pairs of afferent branchial arteries arise
  from the ventral aorta and its two branches, of <span class="pagenum" id="page330"><span
  class="smaller">{330}</span></span>which the first and last supply the anterior walls of the first
  pair of sacs and the posterior walls of the last pair respectively. Each of the remaining afferent
  vessels extends into an interbranchial septum, and supplies the gill-lamellae of the posterior
  wall of one sac and those of the anterior wall of the next sac behind. The corresponding efferent
  branchial vessels have a similar distribution, and unite dorsally to form a median dorsal aorta.
  Beneath the base of the skull the latter vessel divides into two branches which, after receiving
  the first pair of efferent branchial vessels, pursue a divergent course forwards, but subsequently
  converge and unite to form a "circulus cephalicus," as in Teleosts. From the cephalic circle are
  given off on each side (1) an "internal carotid" artery for the brain and eye; (2) an "external
  carotid" for the lateral and ventral walls of the head; and (3) a large ventral branch which
  supplies the lingual apparatus; while from the abdominal portion of the dorsal aorta are derived,
  first, a coeliaco-mesenteric artery for the liver and alimentary canal, and subsequently branches
  for the myotomes, kidneys, and the gonad. The terminal portion of the aorta then enters the tail
  and forms the caudal artery.</p>

  <p>The first or most anterior of these arteries supplies the hyoidean hemibranch, while the
  succeeding four supply the holobranchs of the four branchial arches. The blood is collected from
  the capillaries of the branchial lamellae by a series of efferent branchial vessels, a pair for
  the two hemibranchs of each branchial arch and a single vessel for the hyoidean hemibranch, which
  unite with one another in a somewhat singular fashion. The efferent arteries from the anterior and
  posterior hemibranchs of each branchial cleft unite above and below each cleft in such a way as to
  form a series of complete vascular loops round the hyoidean cleft and the three succeeding
  branchial clefts, which are connected by short longitudinal trunks in each arch and also by a
  longitudinal commissural vessel between their ventral extremities. As the fifth arch is gill-less,
  there is no complete loop round the fifth cleft, the blood collected by the efferent vessel of the
  posterior hemibranch of the fourth arch being conveyed to the corresponding vessel of the anterior
  hemibranch of the same arch by one of the short longitudinal vessels above mentioned. Dorsally,
  each arterial loop is continuous with an epibranchial artery; and by the dorsal union of the four
  <span class="pagenum" id="page332"><span class="smaller">{332}</span></span>epibranchial arteries
  of the two sides the dorsal aorta is formed. It may be pointed out that the anterior efferent
  vessel of each arch, which is usually larger than the posterior one, is to be regarded as the
  primary efferent artery of the corresponding holobranch, and as such is directly continuous with
  an epibranchial artery, the posterior efferent artery being a secondary vessel which opens not
  into the primary trunk of its own branchial arch, but into that of the succeeding arch.<a
  id="NtA_379" href="#Nt_379"><sup>[379]</sup></a> The principal arteries which supply the various
  parts of the head with blood are derived from the first efferent branchial vessel. From the
  ventral end of this artery a mandibular artery is given off, which subdivides into branches for
  the muscles of the lower jaw as well as into nutrient vessels for the hyoidean hemibranch. At
  about the middle of its length the same artery gives off an afferent pseudobranchial or hyoidean
  artery, to the spiracular or mandibular pseudobranch. From the latter organ the blood is collected
  by an anterior carotid artery which, after giving off an ophthalmic branch to the eye, perforates
  the orbital wall and enters the cranial cavity, where it is joined by an anastomotic trunk from
  the posterior carotid of the opposite side; finally, the anterior carotid divides into anterior
  and posterior cerebral arteries for the brain. The third and last of the cephalic arteries is the
  posterior carotid; this artery arises from the dorsal extremity of the first efferent branchial
  vessel, and, on entering the orbit, gives off the anastomotic trunk previously mentioned. The
  latter vessel enters the cranial cavity, and, after crossing its fellow, joins the anterior
  carotid of the opposite side, as described above. The main trunk is then continued forwards in the
  orbit, and its various branches eventually supply the eye-muscles, the mandibular adductor muscle,
  and some other parts of the head.</p>

  <p>It is worthy of note that the median dorsal aorta is prolonged forwards in front of the first
  pair of epibranchial arteries as a slender median vessel (<i>a.d.a</i>), which ultimately divides
  into two branches, each branch uniting with the posterior carotid of its side.</p>

  <p>A remarkable system of arteries for the supply of nutrient blood to the gills and heart has its
  origin in the following <span class="pagenum" id="page333"><span
  class="smaller">{333}</span></span>manner. On each side, the longitudinal commissural vessel,
  which connects the ventral ends of the arterial loops surrounding the different gill-clefts, gives
  origin to a series of pairs of short transverse vessels, and by their union these combine to form
  a median longitudinal hypobranchial artery which lies beneath the ventral aorta. From the
  hypobranchial artery are derived the coronary arteries for the heart; and from the same artery, or
  from its lateral connexions with the longitudinal commissural artery, and, in the case of the
  hyoidean hemibranch, from the mandibular artery, are derived the various nutrient vessels for the
  gills.</p>

  <p>The arteries for the trunk, and for the pectoral and pelvic limbs, arise in succession from the
  dorsal aorta. The first of the series is the subclavian artery, which has its origin from the
  aorta close to the dorsal extremities of the fourth pair of epibranchial arteries. Each subclavian
  artery gives off a brachial artery to the pectoral fin, and is then continued forwards as a
  lateral hypobranchial artery, which, with its fellow of the opposite side, eventually becomes
  continuous with the hinder end of the median hypobranchial artery. Behind the subclavian artery
  there is a median coeliaco-mesenteric artery, the various branches of which are distributed to the
  liver, stomach, and intestine. A lieno-gastric artery supplies the pancreas and spleen, and also
  sends branches to the stomach. In addition, there are also arteries for the gonads, numerous
  segmental arteries for the myotomes, and renal arteries for the kidneys. Finally, the aorta gives
  off a pair of iliac arteries for the pelvic fins, and then enters the haemal canal as the caudal
  artery.</p>

  <p>The more important differences in the arterial system of the Holocephali and the Teleostomi
  relate to (1) the absence of the posterior efferent branchial artery in each branchial arch; (2)
  modifications dependent on the condition of the spiracular and hyoidean hemibranchs, and the mode
  of origin and the course of their afferent and efferent vessels; and (3) the source from whence
  the air-bladder derives its blood when that organ is present.</p>

  <p>(1) The branchial arterial system is somewhat more primitive than in the generality of
  Elasmobranchs.<a id="NtA_380" href="#Nt_380"><sup>[380]</sup></a> There are no complete vascular
  loops round the gill-clefts, and the blood from the two <span class="pagenum" id="page334"><span
  class="smaller">{334}</span></span>hemibranchs of each branchial arch is conveyed to the dorsal
  aorta by a single efferent vessel which corresponds to the more anterior of the two in <i>Mustelus
  antarcticus</i>.<a id="NtA_381" href="#Nt_381"><sup>[381]</sup></a></p>

  <p>(2) In <i>Callorhynchus</i><a id="NtA_382" href="#Nt_382"><sup>[382]</sup></a> among the
  Holocephali, where the spiracle is absent but the hyoidean hemibranchi is still a true gill, the
  latter organ is supplied with venous blood by a branch from the ventral aorta, the corresponding
  efferent vessel joining the dorsal aorta (Fig. 196). In the absence of a spiracular pseudobranch
  the anterior carotid may be regarded as continuous with the hyoidean artery,<a id="NtA_383"
  href="#Nt_383"><sup>[383]</sup></a> and as having its origin directly from the efferent artery of
  the hyoidean hemibranch (Fig. 196). At its origin the anterior carotid anastomoses with the
  mandibular artery.</p>

  <p>The Sturgeon more closely resembles the Elasmobranchs. The hyoidean gill is supplied by an
  afferent branchial artery from the ventral aorta, and its efferent vessel joins the corresponding
  trunk from the holobranch of the first branchial arch. A hyoidean artery supplies the spiracular
  pseudobranch, the efferent vessel of which contributes to the blood-supply of the brain and the
  eye, and probably represents an anterior carotid.</p>

  <p><i>Lepidosteus</i><a id="NtA_384" href="#Nt_384"><sup>[384]</sup></a> offers a singularly
  interesting transition from the <span class="pagenum" id="page335"><span
  class="smaller">{335}</span></span>Elasmobranch to the Teleost. As indicated in the preceding
  chapter, this Fish possesses both a hyoidean gill and a spiracular pseudobranch (Figs. 197 and
  198). The hyoidean gill is supplied by an afferent artery direct from the ventral aorta, but the
  proper efferent vessel of the gill, which primitively joined the dorsal aorta, is suppressed, and
  the blood is collected into a vessel, which, like the hyoidean artery in Elasmobranchs, becomes
  the afferent artery of the spiracular pseudobranch. The latter artery unites, however, with a
  second hyoidean artery derived from the efferent branchial vessel of the first branchial arch, and
  represents the artery termed "hyoidean" in Teleosts. The efferent vessel from the spiracular
  pseudobranch joins an internal branch from the carotid artery, and then distributes its blood both
  to the eye and the brain.</p>

  <p>In Teleosts, as already mentioned in a preceding chapter, it is probable that the hyoidean
  hemibranch is suppressed, the so-called hyoidean pseudobranch being a spiracular pseudobranch. The
  latter is now supplied by a "hyoidean" artery, which has its origin from the ventral end of the
  efferent <span class="pagenum" id="page336"><span class="smaller">{336}</span></span>branchial
  artery of the first branchial arch, the corresponding efferent trunk forming an ophthalmic artery,
  and passing to the choroid gland of the eye (Fig. 199). Both the proper afferent and efferent
  arteries of the hyoidean hemibranch either disappear or, as in the Cod (<i>Gadus morrhua</i>), the
  efferent artery may be represented on each side by an anastomosis between the hyoidean artery and
  the cephalic circle. Hence, the "hyoidean" artery of Teleosts corresponds to the one which has a
  similar origin in <i>Lepidosteus</i>.</p>

  <p>A brief description of the remaining efferent branchial arteries and their derivatives in the

  <p>(3) In most Teleostomi the air-bladder is supplied with blood by branches of the coeliac

  <i>Polypterus</i> and <i>Amia</i><a id="NtA_388" href="#Nt_388"><sup>[388]</sup></a> are, however,

  </div>

  <p>In <i>Neoceratodus</i> (Fig. 200),<a id="NtA_389" href="#Nt_389"><sup>[389]</sup></a> there are
  two efferent vessels to each gill-bearing branchial arch, which unite above to form an
  epibranchial artery, and by the successive union of the four epibranchial arteries a short common
  trunk is formed on each side. Posteriorly, the two trunks unite to form a median dorsal aorta.
  Immediately above the gill-clefts each efferent vessel gives off a branch which, passing either
  forwards or backwards, unites with the corresponding branch of the efferent vessel in front or
  behind as the case may be. A hyoidean artery arises from the ventral extremity of the anterior
  efferent artery of the first branchial arch, and, after giving off a lingual artery, ascends the
  hyoid arch and supplies the hyoidean pseudobranch. The efferent vessel of the pseudobranch
  (<i>a.c.a</i>) or anterior <span class="pagenum" id="page339"><span
  class="smaller">{339}</span></span>carotid artery, eventually enters the cranial cavity and
  subdivides into anterior and posterior cerebral arteries for the brain, also giving off a branch
  which unites with its fellow of the opposite side directly behind the infundibulum. A posterior
  carotid springs from the epibranchial of the first branchial arch and divides into palatine,
  orbital, and ocular branches; and from the ventral end of the anterior efferent vessel of the
  second branchial arch is derived a hypobranchial artery for the heart and pericardium. The
  pulmonary arteries for the lung-like air-bladder have their origin from the fourth pair of
  epibranchial arteries.</p>

  <p>As in so many other details of its anatomy, <i>Neoceratodus</i> exhibits in its arterial system
  abundant evidence of the wide-spreading affinities of the group to which it belongs. In its
  branchial arterial system <i>Neoceratodus</i> presents a singular combination of features which,
  individually, are characteristic of Amphibia and Elasmobranchs. Special Amphibian features may be
  noted in the origin of the afferent branchial arteries almost simultaneously from the anterior end
  of the conus arteriosus; in the mode of union of the epibranchial arteries to form the dorsal
  aortae; in the origin of a lingual artery from the efferent vessel of the first branchial arch;
  and in the derivation on either side of a pulmonary artery from the fourth epibranchial artery.
  Agreement with Elasmobranchs is to be found in the presence of two efferent branchial vessels in
  each branchial arch, although the relations of these arteries are more primitive than in most
  adult Elasmobranchs, inasmuch as the two efferent vessels of the <i>same</i> arch unite to form an
  epibranchial artery; and also in the origin and distribution of the anterior and posterior
  carotids. Lastly may be mentioned the fact that <i>Neoceratodus</i> agrees not only with the
  Amphibia but also with those generalised Teleostomi, <i>Polypterus</i> and <i>Amia</i>, in the
  mode of origin of the great arteries for the air-bladder.</p>

  <p>Of the two remaining Dipnoi, the arterial system of <i>Protopterus</i><a id="NtA_390"
  href="#Nt_390"><sup>[390]</sup></a> is better known than that of <i>Lepidosiren</i>, but in both
  cases further research is needed before a satisfactory comparison can be made with
  <i>Neoceratodus</i> and other Vertebrates. It is evident, nevertheless, that both genera differ
  from <i>Neoceratodus</i> in approximating more closely to the Amphibia than to the <span

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In their origin from the conus the four afferent branchial arteries of <i>Protopterus</i>
  resemble those of <i>Neoceratodus</i>, but their relations to the branchial clefts are somewhat
  different (Fig. 201). The first or hyoidean cleft is closed, and the first afferent vessel lies
  between the second cleft and the third, and is therefore in relation with the second branchial
  arch. The remaining afferent arteries are disposed between the succeeding clefts and are related
  to the corresponding arches. As the second and third arches, like the vestigial first arch, bear
  no gill-lamellae, their afferent arteries are directly continuous with the corresponding efferent
  vessels, as in those Teleosts in which certain arches are gill-less, as well as in the
  Tadpole-stage of the tailless Amphibia when the internal gills begin to degenerate; and they
  apparently transmit arterial blood directly to the dorsal aorta.<a id="NtA_391"
  href="#Nt_391"><sup>[391]</sup></a> The third and fourth afferent arteries, on the contrary,
  supply venous blood to the two hemibranchs which are borne by each of the two corresponding
  arches, viz.: the fourth and fifth, and from each pair of hemibranchs the blood is collected into
  two efferent vessels which unite dorsally <span class="pagenum" id="page341"><span
  class="smaller">{341}</span></span>to form an epibranchial artery. From the dorsal end of the
  fourth afferent artery there arises a recurrent branch which curves round the upper margin of the
  sixth cleft and supplies the gill-lamellae on the posterior margin of that cleft, a fact which
  lends support to the view that these lamellae are "emigrants" from the anterior margin of the
  cleft; the efferent vessel from the "emigrant" lamellae joins the fourth epibranchial artery. The
  blood-supply of the external or cutaneous gills is derived from the dorsal extremities of the
  second, third, and fourth afferent arteries, while the efferent vessels from these organs join the
  corresponding epibranchial arteries; in this respect there is a close resemblance between
  <i>Protopterus</i> and those larval Amphibians which possess similar cutaneous gills. All four
  epibranchial arteries unite together at about the same point to form a short common trunk, the
  right or left dorsal aorta, which subsequently unites with its fellow to form the median dorsal
  aorta.</p>

  <p>There is a so-called "hyoidean" artery, which, however, has its origin, not from an anterior
  efferent branchial vessel as in <i>Neoceratodus</i>, but from the first <i>afferent</i> branchial
  artery. After giving off a submaxillary or lingual artery, the "hyoidean" artery (<i>af</i>)
  becomes the afferent vessel for the "opercular gill" or "hyoidean pseudobranch,"<a id="NtA_392"
  href="#Nt_392"><sup>[392]</sup></a> and supplies the latter with arterial blood. The efferent
  vessel (<i>ef</i>) from the pseudobranch unites with the four epibranchial arteries in forming the
  right or left dorsal aorta. A "carotid" artery arises from the efferent vessel of the "hyoidean
  pseudobranch," and a pulmonary artery has its origin from the root of the dorsal aorta of its
  side, and not from the fourth epibranchial artery as in <i>Neoceratodus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>The Blood.</b>&mdash;The blood consists of a nutritive fluid plasma in which float red
  corpuscles and leucocytes. In the Cyclostomata (e.g. <i>Petromyzon</i>) the red corpuscles are
  circular, but in <i>Myxine</i> they have the usual oval shape. In Fishes the red corpuscles are
  almost invariably flat, oval, biconvex, and nucleated, and owe their colour to the presence of the
  characteristic oxygen-absorbing, iron-containing pigment, haemoglobin. They are unusually large in
  the Dipnoi and are only exceeded in size by those of certain Urodele Amphibians. The leucocytes
  are much less numerous than the red corpuscles, although their relative proportions are very
  variable, even in the same species under different <span class="pagenum" id="page342"><span
  class="smaller">{342}</span></span>conditions. They appear to be more numerous in the Dipnoi (e.g.
  <i>Protopterus</i>) than in any other Vertebrates, except under pathological conditions.<a
  id="NtA_393" href="#Nt_393"><sup>[393]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>The Lymphatic System.</b>&mdash;In addition to blood-vessels, Fishes possess a lymphatic
  system, consisting of smaller vessels, lymph-capillaries or lymph-spaces, distributed in the
  connective tissue of different parts of the body, and by their union ultimately forming larger
  lymph-vessels or sinuses which communicate with certain of the principal veins, the whole forming
  a series of channels for the collection of the blood-plasma which has exuded from the
  blood-capillaries for the nutrition of the tissues, and for its conveyance to the general venous
  system. The fluid in the lymphatics, or lymph, consists of dilute blood-plasma containing
  leucocytes but devoid of red corpuscles. At the points where the larger lymphatics open into the
  veins, lymph-hearts may be developed. In the Eel (<i>Anguilla vulgaris</i>) there is a lymph-heart
  in the tail, which communicates by a valvular orifice with the smaller of the two caudal veins,
  and by its rhythmical pulsations propels the lymph into the vein. In <i>Silurus</i> there are two
  caudal lymph-hearts. Apart from the lymphoid tissue, which is so abundantly present in certain
  parts of the body, Fishes appear to be devoid of the special "lymphatic glands" of the higher
  Vertebrates.</p>

  <p><b>The Ductless or Blood-Glands.</b>&mdash;All the important blood-glands of other Vertebrates
  have their representatives in Fishes. Nothing is certainly known of the function of these organs
  in Fishes, but from the general structural resemblance which they present to their equivalents in
  the higher Vertebrates, it is perhaps not unreasonable to infer that they are similar in function.
  If this be so, the blood-glands of Fishes are organs for leucocyte-formation and phagocytosis,
  involving the destruction and removal of effete red blood-corpuscles; in addition, they may also
  be concerned with certain obscure chemical changes in the composition of the blood, which have an
  important relation to general or local nutrition.</p>

  <p><b>The Spleen.</b>&mdash;This lymphoid organ is the largest of all the blood-glands, and, in
  the form of a compact or more or less lobulated body, is present in all Fishes, and possibly in
  Cyclostomes. In position the spleen is usually in close proximity to the stomach, to which it is
  attached by an extension round it <span class="pagenum" id="page343"><span
  class="smaller">{343}</span></span>of the peritoneal investment of that organ. Thus, in the
  Dog-Fish (<i>Scyllium</i>), the spleen is a large reddish body attached to the convexity of the
  <span class="sans fwb">U</span>-shaped stomach, and, in addition, sends a long narrow lobe between
  the distal limb and the valvate portion of the intestine (Fig. 153, <i>spl</i>). In the Sturgeon
  (<i>Acipenser</i>), the organ is also large, but is attached to the left side of the commencement
  of the intestine. In the Cod (<i>Gadus</i>) among Teleosts the spleen is much elongated and is
  situated on the dorsal side of the stomach. In the Dipnoi (e.g. <i>Protopterus</i>)<a id="NtA_394"
  href="#Nt_394"><sup>[394]</sup></a> the organ is probably represented by a large compact lymphoid
  mass, closely connected with the dorsal and lateral walls of the stomach (Fig. 154, A,
  <i>s</i>).</p>

  <p><b>The Thyroid Gland.</b>&mdash;This organ<a id="NtA_395" href="#Nt_395"><sup>[395]</sup></a>
  usually arises in the form of a small median evagination of the hypoblastic epithelium of the
  ventral wall of the pharynx, in the region of the second visceral arch. Later it becomes detached
  from the place of origin and converted into a solid spherical body. Eventually the component cells
  form the limiting epithelium of a series of follicles or vesicles embedded in a matrix of
  connective tissue and blood-vessels, and the characteristic adult structure is attained.</p>

  <p>Among the Cyclostomata the evagination is relatively large in the young Lamprey (<i>Petromyzon
  fluviatilis</i>), as also is the orifice of communication with the pharynx (Fig. 202,
  <i>th</i>).<a id="NtA_396" href="#Nt_396"><sup>[396]</sup></a> The aperture soon becomes reduced
  to a mere pore, and finally disappears. During the larval or Ammocoetes-stage the organ consists
  of a median ciliated portion, communicating with a pair of laterally placed glandular sacs, but in
  the adult it is much smaller, and acquires the usual follicular structure. In adult Elasmobranchs
  the thyroid is represented by a moderately large compact organ, situated near the anterior end of
  the ventral aorta. In Teleostomi the organ may be paired, or, as in the Perch (<i>Perca</i>), more
  diffuse, consisting of masses of reddish lobules lying beneath the aorta, and also scattered for a
  variable distance along the course of the afferent branchial arteries.</p>

  <p>In the Dipnoi (e.g. <i>Protopterus</i>)<a id="NtA_397" href="#Nt_397"><sup>[397]</sup></a> the
  thyroid is small, <span class="pagenum" id="page344"><span
  class="smaller">{344}</span></span>consisting of two lateral lobes connected by a constricted
  median portion, and situated beneath the epithelium of the tongue, immediately above the hyoidean
  symphysis. A similar structure has been described by Bischoff<a id="NtA_398"
  href="#Nt_398"><sup>[398]</sup></a> in <i>Lepidosiren</i>, and was regarded by him as a salivary
  gland.</p>

  <p>As in Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals, paired or accessory thyroid bodies ("supra-pericardial
  organs")<a id="NtA_399" href="#Nt_399"><sup>[399]</sup></a> are present in many Fishes, and appear
  to be similar in structure to the median thyroid. In Elasmobranchs these bodies originate as a
  pair of outgrowths from the epithelium of the pharynx behind the last pair of branchial arches
  (Fig. 202, B, <i>a.th</i>). Subsequently they become detached from the pharynx, and in the adult
  are situated on the dorsal side of the pericardium, remote from the median thyroid.</p>

  </div>

  <p>According to Dohrn the median thyroid is to be regarded as the vestige of a gill-cleft which
  primitively existed between the hyomandibular cartilage and the hyoidean arch. This conclusion
  seems, however, to be less in harmony with the facts of development than the view<a id="NtA_400"
  href="#Nt_400"><sup>[400]</sup></a> that the organ is derived from the characteristic
  hypobranchial groove or "endostyle" of Ascidians <span class="pagenum" id="page345"><span
  class="smaller">{345}</span></span>and Amphioxus, which has undergone a change of function from a
  mucus-conveying groove to a blood-gland. On the other hand, the mode of origin of the paired
  thyroids certainly favours the suggestion that they represent a posterior pair of vestigial
  gill-clefts, a view which derives some support from the fact that in <i>Notidanus</i>, where
  additional branchial arches and clefts are present, the paired thyroids are absent.</p>

  <p><b>The Thymus.</b>&mdash;In the embryo Elasmobranch and Teleost<a id="NtA_401"
  href="#Nt_401"><sup>[401]</sup></a> the thymus has a multiple origin, being derived from a series
  of distinct epithelial thickenings, one of which is developed at the dorsal extremity of each of
  the gill-clefts except of the spiracle. These rudiments subsequently detach themselves from the
  epithelial surface and sink inwards, eventually fusing together on each side to form a single
  independent structure. Later, the epithelial mass thus formed becomes invaded by connective
  tissue, and by leucocytes which form lymph follicles, and the thymus gradually assumes the
  structure of a lymphoid organ. From its mode of development it has been suggested that the thymus
  owes its evolution to the metamorphosis and ingrowth of branchial filaments,<a id="NtA_402"
  href="#Nt_402"><sup>[402]</sup></a> but it is also noteworthy that each embryonic rudiment of the
  organ closely resembles, both in position and origin, one of the developing branchial tongue-bars
  of Amphioxus.<a id="NtA_403" href="#Nt_403"><sup>[403]</sup></a> The abundance of leucocytes which
  it contains has also prompted the further suggestion that the origin of the thymus may be due to
  the necessity of providing for the phagocytic protection of the gills themselves from the ravages
  of harmful micro-organisms, fungoid spores, etc., as well as to aid in the removal of such
  portions of the gills as may have been injured.<a id="NtA_404"
  href="#Nt_404"><sup>[404]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A thymus is probably present in all Fishes, if not in the adult at all events in the embryo,
  but is always relatively small in size. In Elasmobranchs the organ lies on each side above the
  branchial arches and beneath the dorsal musculature; and in Teleostomi at the dorsal extremity of
  the last branchial arch, in close proximity to the mucous membrane of the branchial cavity. In a
  similar position in the Dipnoi (e.g. <i>Protopterus</i>)<a id="NtA_405"
  href="#Nt_405"><sup>[405]</sup></a> there are, on each side, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page346"><span class="smaller">{346}</span></span>two contiguous lobes of lymphoid tissue
  which apparently represent a thymus.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>The Supra-renal Bodies.</b>&mdash;The supra-renal bodies are organs of problematic function,
  which are present in the Cyclostomata, and probably in all Fishes, and situated in close proximity
  to the kidneys.</p>

  <p>In the Cyclostomata (<i>Petromyzon</i>) these bodies are represented by lobules of cells along
  the posterior cardinal veins, and also by masses of peculiar cells ("chromaffin cells") along the
  sides of the aorta and segmental arteries.<a id="NtA_406" href="#Nt_406"><sup>[406]</sup></a> In
  Elasmobranchs there are two distinct structures, the paired supra-renals and the inter-renals
  (Fig. 203, A). The former are a series of pairs of segmentally arranged bodies, situated on the
  successive pairs of segmental arteries given off from the dorsal aorta. The two bodies which form
  the first pair are much larger than any of the others, and were formerly spoken of as "axillary
  hearts." The inter-renal is usually a thin elongated "ochre-yellow" body, from which one or two
  lobes may be detached in front, and extends for a variable distance in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page347"><span class="smaller">{347}</span></span>the median line between the two kidneys, or
  is unsymmetrically placed on the ventral surface of either kidney.<a id="NtA_407"
  href="#Nt_407"><sup>[407]</sup></a> Sometimes (e.g. in <i>Raia</i>) the inter-renals are paired,
  in which case they are applied to the inner and hinder margins of the kidneys. In the Sturgeon
  (<i>Acipenser sturio</i>) the "supra-renals" appear as numerous "ochre-yellow" bodies, variable in
  size and distribution (Fig. 203, B). Some of them are visible on the surface of the kidneys, while
  others are scattered about in their substance, but on the whole are more anteriorly placed than in
  Teleosts. In the latter group the "supra-renals" are usually two in number (Fig. 203, C), but may
  be as many as five or reduced to one. They are disposed either on the ventral or the dorsal
  surface of the kidneys, generally near their hinder extremities, or more or less deeply embedded
  in their substance. Besides these bodies there are also chromaffin cells in the walls of the
  anterior cardinal veins.<a id="NtA_408" href="#Nt_408"><sup>[408]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Histologically, the paired segmentally arranged bodies of Elasmobranchs differ considerably in
  structure from the inter-renal bodies, the former resembling the "medulla," while the
  inter-renals, as well as the so-called supra-renals of <i>Acipenser</i>, exhibit a striking
  resemblance to the alveolar "cortical" substance of the Mammalian supra-renals.<a id="NtA_409"
  href="#Nt_409"><sup>[409]</sup></a> In Cyclostomes the cortex is apparently represented by the
  lobules of cells along the posterior cardinal veins and the medulla by the "chromaffin" cells,
  while in Teleosts the cortex and the medulla have their respective counterparts in the
  supra-renals and the "chromaffin" cells in the walls of the anterior cardinal veins. It may be
  concluded, therefore, that Elasmobranchs, Cyclostomes, and Teleosts possess anatomically distinct
  representatives of both the "medulla" and "cortex" of Mammalia, although the Sturgeon is at
  present only known to possess the equivalent of the "cortex." In Amphibia, Reptilia, and Aves both
  "cortex" and "medulla" are present, and in the varying intimacy of their relations offer a
  transition to the Mammalian arrangement of a central medulla closely invested by a sheath of
  cortical substance. A more or less intimate connexion exists between the paired supra-renals of
  Elasmobranchs and the sympathetic nervous <span class="pagenum" id="page348"><span
  class="smaller">{348}</span></span>system. The former are usually well supplied with sympathetic
  nerve fibres, and contain ganglion-cells in their substance.</p>

  <p>The primitive origin of these organs is very obscure, and as regards their development there is
  much diversity of opinion. It seems certain, however, that the cortex and medulla of the higher
  Vertebrates, including their equivalents in the Elasmobranchs, have independent origins, and the
  balance of opinion seems to point to the derivation of the cortex from some portion of the
  germinal coelomic epithelium, while the medulla is derived from the embryonic nerve cells of the
  sympathetic ganglia.</p>

  <p><b>Lymphoid Tissue.</b>&mdash;In addition to certain of the ductless glands, and the local or
  diffused masses of their characteristic tissue already mentioned in connexion with the alimentary
  canal, lymphoid tissue is often abundantly present in other parts of the body. There is, for
  example, a mass of this tissue on the heart of the Sturgeon (<i>Acipenser</i>). The anterior
  enlarged portion of the mesonephros, commonly termed the "head-kidney" of the Teleostomi (Fig.
  203, B, C), is almost entirely composed of lymphoid tissue,<a id="NtA_410"
  href="#Nt_410"><sup>[410]</sup></a> which has replaced, wholly or partially, the proper renal
  structure; and from the presence of free red blood-corpuscles and of crystals of oxy-haemoglobin
  and other derivatives of haemoglobin, it may be inferred that the "head-kidney," in common with
  the more orthodox blood-glands, performs a blood-destroying function.<a id="NtA_411"
  href="#Nt_411"><sup>[411]</sup></a> On the other hand, the example of the spleen, which is alike
  the seat of leucocyte-formation and of blood-destruction, renders it unnecessary to reject the
  view that the "head-kidney" is an organ in which leucocytes or blood-corpuscles are formed. In but
  few Teleostomi is a purely lymphoid "head-kidney" entirely wanting, as, for example, in the
  Sun-Fish (<i>Orthagoriscus mola</i>).<a id="NtA_412" href="#Nt_412"><sup>[412]</sup></a> As
  previously mentioned the Dipnoi are remarkable for the extraordinary development of lymphoid
  tissue, inasmuch as it forms a thick investing mass round the kidneys and gonads in addition to
  its exceptional abundance in the walls of the alimentary canal.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The absence of ordinary lymphatic glands in Fishes is well known, and it is at
  least probable that, functionally, the want of these lymphoid organs may be compensated for by the
  superabundance of lymphoid tissue in other parts of the body.<a id="NtA_413"

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="smaller">MUSCULAR
  SYSTEM&mdash;LOCOMOTION&mdash;SOUND-PRODUCING ORGANS&mdash;ELECTRIC ORGANS</span></p>

  <p><b>Muscular System.</b>&mdash;The various muscles of the body may be arranged in two systems:
  (i.) the <i>somatic</i> or <i>parietal</i>, composed of striated or voluntary muscle-fibres; and
  (ii.) the <i>splanchnic</i> or <i>visceral</i>, consisting for the most part of unstriated or
  involuntary fibres. Somatic muscles form the great lateral longitudinal muscles of the trunk and
  tail, which retain the primitive embryonic metamerism to a greater extent in Fishes than in any
  other Vertebrates, and are the principal muscles associated with locomotion. The lateral muscles
  are composed of a series of transverse muscle-segments or myotomes, which are <span class="sans
  fwb"> ></span>-shaped, or <span class="sans fwb">S</span>-shaped, or they even take a zigzag
  course from above downward. The myotomes are disposed in pairs, and they are separated from one
  another by fibrous septa or myocommata. Each myotome is divided into a dorsal or epiaxial portion,
  and a ventral or hypaxial portion, by a longitudinal, horizontal, fibrous septum extending
  outwards from the vertebral centra to the skin. The muscles of the pectoral and pelvic fins are
  derivatives from more or fewer of the adjacent myotomes. The splanchnic muscles include the
  musculature of the walls of the alimentary canal, as well as those specialised portions of the
  visceral system which are represented by the muscles of the branchial arches and the jaws, and are
  composed of striated fibres.</p>

  <p><b>Locomotion.</b>&mdash;A Fish and a Bird are equally remarkable for the many and various ways
  in which they are adapted for locomotion in the particular medium in which they live. In its shape
  the Fish is admirably adapted for cleaving the water. Spindle-like in shape, but thicker in front
  than behind, a Fish resembles <span class="pagenum" id="page350"><span
  class="smaller">{350}</span></span>a double wedge, the thick part of which is represented by the
  head and one of the thin edges by the free hinder margin of the caudal fin. The body is bounded by
  smooth flowing contour lines, unbroken by any sharp separation of the body regions from one
  another, and with no points of resistance to its forward motion through the water. The body being
  thicker in front than behind, and, as seen in transverse section, broader above than below, it
  follows that its centre of gravity will be nearer the head than the tail, and nearer the dorsal
  than the ventral surface. The dorsal position of the centre of gravity necessarily renders the
  equilibrium of the body unstable, and were it not for the balancing action of the paired fins the
  Fish would float belly upwards, as is always the case after death. Most Fishes are provided with a
  membranous gas-containing sac, the air-bladder, the principal function of which is to render the
  Fish, bulk for bulk, of the same weight as the water, so that in this position of equilibrium, or
  plane of least effort, the animal can execute its various locomotor movements with a minimum
  expenditure of muscular effort&mdash;an advantage which no other animal possesses.<a id="NtA_414"
  href="#Nt_414"><sup>[414]</sup></a> To give stability to the body, and to steady its course when
  swimming, the Fish has a dorsal and a ventral keel, formed by the anal and dorsal fins, which,
  like the sliding keel of a yacht, can be raised or lowered as occasion requires. When these fins
  are removed the course of the Fish becomes zigzag, and the animal wobbles.</p>

  <p>The organs more directly concerned with swimming are the tail and the caudal fin, and the
  pectoral and pelvic fins, but the relative share which these structures take in the actual
  propulsion of the Fish differs greatly. The principal organ of locomotion in the typical Fish is
  the powerful muscular tail, which, in swimming, is lashed from side to side by the alternating
  contraction of the great longitudinal muscles on opposite sides of the vertebral column.<a
  id="NtA_415" href="#Nt_415"><sup>[415]</sup></a> In such movements the tail is first flexed or
  bent, say to the right side: this stroke has been termed the non-effective or back stroke. By a
  stroke in the reverse direction the tail is then extended and straightened, that is to say, the
  Fish makes the forward or effective stroke. By a rapid succession of such strokes to the right and
  left sides alternately the Fish is <span class="pagenum" id="page351"><span
  class="smaller">{351}</span></span>forced through the water. It is obvious, however, that the
  extension or effective stroke must have a considerable surplus of power over the flexion or
  non-effective stroke, and how this result is achieved will now be briefly considered. Experiment,
  and the observation of Fishes like the Sturgeon, which habitually move with sufficient slowness to
  allow the phases of their swimming movements to be followed without much difficulty, show that in
  swimming a Fish throws its body into two opposite and complementary curves, a cephalic curve
  formed by the anterior half of the body and a caudal curve by the tail. The double curve enables
  the Fish always to present a convex, less resisting or non-biting surface to the water during the
  flexion of the tail to the right or left as the case may be, and a concave or biting surface
  during extension, that is when the tail is straightening itself during the effective stroke.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">
    <a href="images/fig204.jpg"><img style="width:18%" src="images/fig204.jpg" alt="fig204"
    title="fig204" ></a>
    <div class="smaller ac">
      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 204.</span>&mdash;To illustrate the mode in which the
      tail of an ordinary Fish is used in swimming. See the text for the lettering. (Slightly
      altered from Pettigrew.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Fig. 204, which represents a Fish in two successive positions while swimming, will serve to
  illustrate these conclusions. A Fish in the position A has its body thrown into a cephalic
  concavity directed to the right and a caudal concave surface facing the left. The tail is bent to
  the right of the line <i>a b</i>, which corresponds to the axis of the Fish when at rest and to
  the course pursued by the animal when swimming, and is in the position which it assumes during a
  flexion stroke, with its convex non-biting surface directed outwards and its concave biting
  surface inwards. The tail is now ready for an extension stroke, and while this is in progress it
  is clear that the concave biting surface of the tail will meet the water, while at the conclusion
  of the stroke the tail will be in a line with <i>a b</i>. At the same time the cephalic curve has
  so far diminished that the long axis of the body for a momentary period will also coincide with
  <i>a b</i>, and the Fish is free to advance without impediment. The tail, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page352"><span class="smaller">{352}</span></span>however, continues its movement to the left,
  but now as a flexion stroke, and assumes the curvature and position indicated in B, with a
  reversal in the direction of both the cephalic and caudal curves, but in the meantime the force of
  the preceding extension stroke has forced the Fish along the line <i>a b</i> to the new position
  indicated by B. By a rapid succession of alternating flexions and extensions, during which the
  tail describes figure-of-8 curves, the Fish travels in an undulating forward course with a maximum
  of propelling power and a minimum of "slip." In short, the action of the tail precisely resembles
  the action of the stern-oar in the operation of sculling a boat.</p>

  <p>There are also other considerations which add to the surplus power of the extension stroke by
  lessening the resistance of the water to the flexion or non-effective stroke. During the flexion
  stroke the tail fin is less expanded and its area diminished, and by the rotation of the Fish on
  its long axis the surface of the tail strikes the water obliquely, and further, the tail moves
  with less rapidity. On the contrary, when the extension stroke is made these conditions are
  reversed. The caudal fin is expanded, the stroke is more rapid, and by the reverse rotation of the
  Fish the tail now strikes the water with its flat surface. In other words, the action of the tail
  during the two strokes may be compared to the "feathering" of an oar in rowing. Nor is this all. A
  Fish in motion through the water produces a suction current behind it. The current offers but
  little resistance to the flexion stroke, inasmuch as the direction of the two coincide, but during
  the extension stroke the tail meets the full force of the current, and consequently its grip and
  propelling power are greatly enhanced. There is a striking analogy between the movements of a
  Fish's tail in swimming and the action of the screw of a steamer, but as a propelling organ the
  former is far superior to the latter. As we have seen, the tail of a living Fish can so adjust its
  shape and surface that it alternately eludes and grips the water in accordance with the needs of
  particular strokes.</p>

  <p>The curves into which the body of a Fish is thrown when swimming are never less than two, but
  in long-bodied Fishes, such as the Eels, the number may be increased, and in every case the curves
  occur in pairs and are complementary to one another.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page353"><span class="smaller">{353}</span></span></div>

  <p>Many Fishes can jump out of the water, either in pursuit of insect food, like the Trout, or to
  enable them to escape the pursuit of their foes, like the Flying-Fish (<i>Exocoetus</i>), by means
  of a single forcible stroke of the tail, when the Fish is in a nearly vertical position close to
  the surface of the water. It is thus that the Salmon executes its remarkable leaps over weirs or
  up salmon-ladders when ascending rivers for spawning.</p>

  <p>The tail is also used for steering. If kept bent to one side when the Fish is moving the tail
  acts like a rudder, and the course of the Fish is deflected to that side; or the direction may be
  altered by single strokes of the tail to the right or left, according to the course which the Fish
  desires to pursue.</p>

  <p>In the majority of Fishes the paired fins are probably of little use for propulsion, and their
  action in this as in other functions is not always clear. In the Sharks and Dog-Fishes as well as
  in some Teleosts their planes are nearly horizontal when the fins are extended from the body; in
  others they are more oblique, so that the surfaces of the fins look upwards and backwards, and
  downwards and forwards; and in others again their surfaces are so nearly vertical that their
  strokes will be backwards and forwards. The pectoral fins also vary in their position on the sides
  of the body, being much more dorsal in some Fishes than in others. The paired fins may act as
  lateral keels in steadying the course of the Fish especially when the fins are extended and their
  planes are horizontal. They certainly seem to act as balancers in keeping the Fish on an even
  keel, and in counteracting the tendency of the Fish to turn belly upwards&mdash;a result which is
  attained by a slight upward and downward movement of the fins, and particularly of the pectoral
  fins. A Fish deprived of its pectoral members sinks downwards at the head and assumes an oblique
  position in the water. Removal of both the pectoral and pelvic fins of one side causes the Fish to
  roll over to that side; and if the fins are removed from both sides the animal turns belly upwards
  like a dead Fish. The pectoral fins may also be used for steering: a backward stroke of one fin
  while the other is kept folded back against the body will wheel the Fish round to the opposite
  side. From the ventral position of its mouth a Shark is forced to turn over to one side in order
  to seize its prey, and this movement of rotation is probably produced by the down strokes of the
  pectoral fin of one side. In <span class="pagenum" id="page354"><span
  class="smaller">{354}</span></span>some Fishes it would seem that the pectoral fins may assist
  locomotion by acting as paddles. The 15-spined Stickleback (<i>Gastrosteus spinosus</i>)
  frequently progresses by their aid alone; and, as their action can be reversed at pleasure, it is
  not unusual to see this Fish move backwards. The fins appear to be rotated or twisted in spiral
  movements like the tail when used for swimming, or like the wings of Insects in flying.</p>

  <p>It has been mentioned that the function of the median fins (dorsal and anal) is to give
  stability to the Fish by acting as dorsal and ventral keels. This is certainly the case in the
  generality of Fishes. Nevertheless, there are exceptional instances in which one, or even both, of
  these fins are important swimming organs, acting either as a substitute for a tail which has
  become adapted for other uses, or as supplementary to that organ. Thus, in some of the
  Syngnathidae (Pipe-Fishes and Sea-Horses) the small size or absence of the caudal fin, and its use
  as a prehensile organ, renders the tail of little or no value as a propelling organ: hence it is
  that these Fishes swim by a lateral undulating movement of the dorsal fin. To enable them to do
  this the supporting skeleton presents certain interesting modifications. In the majority of
  Teleosts the arrangement of the fin-muscles, and the nature of the articulation between the dermal
  fin-rays and their basal radial supports, which is generally some form of a hinge-joint, are such
  as to limit the motion of the rays to simple elevation or depression in the vertical plane, and no
  lateral motion of the fin is possible. But in the Syngnathidae, as in the Pipe-Fish
  (<i>Siphonostoma typhle</i>), there is an exceptionally mobile articulation between the dermal
  fin-rays and the distal radial nodules which their cleft bases embrace and the bony proximal or
  basal radials, so that the fin can be flexed or bent to the right or to the left. In addition to
  this, by a change in the insertion of their tendons, the muscles corresponding to the ordinary
  elevator and depressor muscles of the fin-rays in other Fishes are capable of producing extensive
  lateral movements of the fin, or, by contracting in orderly sequence, of bringing about the
  characteristic undulating motion of the fin. A similar mechanism exists in many Plectognathi
  (<i>e.g.</i> species of <i>Balistes</i>, <i>Monacanthus</i>, <i>Diodon</i>, <i>Tetrodon</i> and
  <i>Orthagoriscus</i>)<a id="NtA_416" href="#Nt_416"><sup>[416]</sup></a> in connexion with both
  the dorsal and anal fins, but in these Fishes the <span class="pagenum" id="page355"><span
  class="smaller">{355}</span></span>action of the median fins in swimming must be regarded as
  supplementary to that of the tail.</p>

  <p>Swimming is by no means the only form of locomotion in vogue amongst Fishes. A few, like the
  Angler-Fishes (<i>Lophius</i>), habitually use the pectoral fins for crawling about the
  sea-bottom. The East Indian Goby, <i>Periophthalmus</i>, uses its pectoral fins, which are bent at
  an angle like an elbow-joint, for hopping over sandy flats left bare by the retreating tide. The
  Flying-Fish (<i>Exocoetus</i>), when projected from the water by a stroke of its powerful tail,
  expands its large pectoral fins, and, using them after the fashion of a parachute, floats through
  the air for considerable distances before returning to its natural medium. The "Flying Gurnards"
  (<i>Dactylopterus</i>) are also capable of short aerial excursions in a similar fashion. Nor is
  tree-climbing beyond the province of a Fish, if credit be given to the assertion that the Indian
  "Climbing-Perch" (<i>Anabas scandens</i>) uses its opercular spines for ascending trees. Many
  freshwater Fishes are known to migrate across land from one pool or river to another, usually
  during the night. Eels do so by a serpentine or wriggling motion of their long bodies, but in
  others the pectoral fins seem to be the principal organs used for the purpose, aided, it may be,
  by a perverted use of the tail.</p>

  <p><b>Sound-producing Organs.</b>&mdash;Contrary to popular belief sound-producing or vocal organs
  are by no means uncommon in Fishes, especially in certain families of Teleosts. It is not always
  easy, however, to discriminate between involuntary, abnormal, or accidental sounds, and those due
  to the action of special vocal organs. There are, moreover, some Fishes which observations have
  shown to utter highly characteristic sounds, although the precise nature of the sound-producing
  mechanism is at present unknown; while other Fishes appear to possess organs which, on anatomical
  grounds, are perhaps vocal in function, although nothing is known of the nature of the sounds they
  emit. Here those organs only will be considered which, either with certainty or with some degree
  of probability, may be regarded as vocal structures. For most of our knowledge of these
  interesting structures we are indebted to the researches of S&ouml;rensen and Dufoss&eacute;.<a id="NtA_417"

  <p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Stridulation</i>.&mdash;Stridulation as a method of sound-production has been
  recorded in many Teleosts, and one of the most interesting examples occurs in the singular Indian
  Siluroid, (<i>Callomystax gagata</i>).<a id="NtA_418" href="#Nt_418"><sup>[418]</sup></a> In this
  Fish (Fig. 205) the first five vertebrae are rigidly connected with one another and with the
  skull, mainly through the union of the neural spines of the third, fourth, and fifth vertebrae,
  and their articulation with the supra-occipital bone. The united spines together form a high,
  laterally-compressed lamina of bone, the hinder portion of which is vertically cleft into two thin
  plates separated by an interval sufficiently wide to receive the first interspinous bone of the
  dorsal fin. The inner surface of each of the two plates is traversed by a series of about thirty
  parallel, close-set, vertical ridges, while the first interspinous bone is similarly ridged on
  both its faces like a double file. Lastly, it may be mentioned that owing to the width of the
  intervertebral ligament between them the fifth and sixth vertebral centra are articulated by a
  joint of unusual mobility. The action of the mechanism is simple. By the vertical movements of the
  sixth and succeeding trunk vertebrae, with the interspinous bones which they support, on the rigid
  structure formed by the head and first five vertebrae, the file-like first interspinous bone moves
  backwards and forwards, and, by scraping against the ridges on the inner surfaces of the cleft
  neural spines, gives rise to a harsh grating noise, which is particularly unpleasant when
  artificially produced. The lateral movements of the trunk in ordinary locomotion do not affect the
  mechanism: it is only when the trunk is alternately flexed and extended in the vertical plane that
  the mechanism comes into play and a noise is <span class="pagenum" id="page357"><span
  class="smaller">{357}</span></span>produced. In the Bull-head (<i>Cottus scorpius</i>) the
  preoperculum is modified for stridulation, and in <i>Dactylopterus</i> the hyomandibular bone; in
  other Fishes, as in some Siluroids (<i>e.g.</i> species of <i>Doras</i>), stridulation takes place
  between a basal process from the great spine of the pectoral fin and the wall of a socket in the
  cleithrum into which the process is received, or between the small first spine of the dorsal fin
  and a roof-like process at the upper extremity of the first interspinous bone; also, in a somewhat
  similar fashion in the anterior dorsal fin of such widely different Fishes as certain
  Trigger-Fishes (Sclerodermi) pertaining to the genera <i>Balistes</i>, <i>Monacanthus</i>, and
  <i>Triacanthus</i>, <i>Acanthurus chirurgus</i> (Acanthuridae), the Boar-Fish (<i>Capros
  aper</i>), <i>Centriscus scolopax</i> (Centriscidae), and the Three-spined Stickleback
  (<i>Gastrosteus aculeatus</i>); and even between the spinose ray of the pelvic fin and the
  basipterygium in <i>Triacanthus</i>, <i>Capros</i>, and <i>Gastrosteus</i>.</p>

  <p>In the "Drumming" Trigger-Fish (<i>Balistes aculeatus</i>),<a id="NtA_419"
  href="#Nt_419"><sup>[419]</sup></a> which frequents the coral-reefs off the Island of Mauritius,
  stridulation takes place between the postclavicles and a longitudinally grooved area on the inner
  surface of each cleithrum. Both the cleithra and postclavicles are in intimate relation with the
  air-bladder, and the sound produced by friction is apparently strengthened by the transference of
  the vibrations to the walls and gaseous contents of that organ. The passage of the
  sound-vibrations to the surrounding medium is facilitated by the fact that for a portion of their
  extent the lateral walls of the air-bladder are in contact with the superficial skin, which
  visibly shares in the vibratory movement of the bladder when the characteristic drumming sounds of
  <i>Balistes</i> are being emitted.</p>

  <p>Stridulating sounds may also be produced by the friction of the upper and lower pharyngeal
  teeth, as in a species of Mackerel (<i>Scomber brachyurus</i>). By the grating of its teeth the
  Sun-Fish (<i>Orthagoriscus mola</i>) is said to emit sounds similar to those produced by the
  grinding of the teeth in Pigs and Ruminants; and Moseley<a id="NtA_420"
  href="#Nt_420"><sup>[420]</sup></a> has remarked of a species of <i>Balistes</i> that the "living
  Fish when held in the hand makes a curious metallic clicking noise by grating its teeth."</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Breathing sounds</i>.&mdash;Characteristic breathing or murmuring sounds, or
  "bruits de souffle" as Dufoss&eacute; terms them, are <span class="pagenum" id="page358"><span
  class="smaller">{358}</span></span>produced by a few Teleosts, among which may be mentioned the
  Eels, certain Cyprinidae, as, for example, the Carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio</i>), several species of
  Loaches (e.g. <i>Misgurnus fossilis</i> and <i>Cobitis taenia</i>), and the European Siluroid,
  <i>Silurus glanis</i>. According to Dufoss&eacute; these sounds originate in some cases from the
  expulsion of gas from the air-bladder through the ductus pneumaticus and mouth, and in others, as
  in <i>Misgurnus fossilis</i>, they are produced by the rapid ejection through the anus of bubbles
  of air previously taken in at the mouth.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Sounds produced through the agency of muscles connected with the
  air-bladder</i>.&mdash;In addition to its usual function as a hydrostatic organ or "float" the
  air-bladder is often modified in various ways in different Teleosts, and adapted for use as a
  sound-producing organ.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the South American Siluroid, <i>Auchenipterus nodosus</i>, the transverse processes of the
  fourth vertebra are bent downwards and backwards, and at the same time become converted into
  flexible and highly elastic springs (Fig. 206, B). Their distal extremities expand into oval bony
  plates which are imbedded in the anterior wall of the air-bladder, and often cause the latter to
  bulge inwards (Fig. 206, A). From the occipital region of the skull arise two powerful muscles
  which pass backwards to <span class="pagenum" id="page359"><span
  class="smaller">{359}</span></span>their insertion into the anterior faces of the two springs. By
  the contraction of these muscles the springs, and consequently also the front wall of the bladder,
  are drawn forwards; but directly the muscles relax, the elasticity of the springs causes them to
  move backwards to their former position, carrying with them the wall of the air-bladder. Hence it
  follows that the rapid alternating contraction and relaxation of the muscles will impart a
  vibratory movement to the anterior wall of the bladder and to the gaseous contents of that organ,
  with the result that a sound is produced. As a rule, those Fishes in which an
  elastic-spring-mechanism is present have the air-bladder subdivided by internal septa into a
  series of chambers freely communicating with one another; and no doubt the intensity of the sound
  is greatly increased by the vibratory movements of the gases across the free edges of the septa,
  and from one chamber to another. The elastic-spring type of vocal organ is apparently restricted
  to the Siluridae,<a id="NtA_421" href="#Nt_421"><sup>[421]</sup></a> and besides occurring in
  <i>Auchenipterus</i> is found also in the South American genera <i>Doras</i>, <i>Oxydoras</i>,
  <i>Rhinodoras</i>, and <i>Euanemus</i>; in the African genera <i>Synodontis</i> and
  <i>Malopterurus</i>; and in at least four species of the Indian genus <i>Pangasius</i>.<a
  id="NtA_422" href="#Nt_422"><sup>[422]</sup></a> There are also a few Teleosts in which the
  air-bladder is provided with special muscles, but, instead of being connected with elastic
  springs, the muscles extend from the skull, and are inserted directly into the wall of the bladder
  (Fig. 207); or, without being in any way attached to the skeleton, the muscles simply invest some
  portion of the surface of the air-bladder. In other Fishes the air-bladder, without possessing
  special muscles of its own, may, nevertheless, be partially invested by tendinous, or partly
  muscular and partly tendinous, extensions from the muscles of the body-wall (Fig. 208), or may be
  intimately related to certain muscles connected with the pectoral girdle.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Whatever the precise relation of the air-bladder to its muscles it is probable that the
  physiological effect is in most cases the same. By the rapid alternating contraction and
  relaxation of the muscles, some part of the wall of the bladder becomes alternately compressed and
  relaxed in such a way as to initiate a series of vibratory movements in the gases of that organ,
  and so produce definite sounds. In not a few of the Fishes the cavity of the bladder is subdivided
  by external constrictions or by internal septa, or is complicated by the development of lateral,
  tubular, caecal branches; and hence the vibratory movements of the gases will be greatly
  strengthened by their passage across the edges of the septa, or the apertures of the caeca, and
  the intensity of the resultant sounds also increased. It will be readily understood that the
  nature and quality of the sounds emitted by different Fishes will necessarily vary with the shape
  of the air-bladder, the number and arrangement of the internal septa and the caeca, and the
  strength and disposition of the contracting muscles. In a few Teleosts (Triglidae and Zeidae)
  sounds are said to be produced by the rapid vibration of an annular, or centrally-perforated,
  muscular diaphragm, which stretches across the cavity of the air-bladder.<a id="NtA_423"
  href="#Nt_423"><sup>[423]</sup></a> Nevertheless, it must be strongly emphasised that, while in
  some Fishes the air-bladder and its muscles <span class="pagenum" id="page361"><span
  class="smaller">{361}</span></span>undoubtedly constitute a vocal organ, there are many others in
  which the bladder can only be inferred to be sound-producing from its general agreement in
  anatomical structure with the same organ in Fishes where its vocal function has been clearly
  proved.</p>

  <p>By one or other of these various methods the air-bladder is either known to be sound-producing,
  or is believed with good reason to be such, in the following Teleosts,<a id="NtA_424"
  href="#Nt_424"><sup>[424]</sup></a> and many others:&mdash;Certain species of the South-American
  genera of Siluridae, <i>Pimelodus</i>, <i>Sorubim</i>, <i>Platystoma</i>, <i>Piratinga</i>,
  <i>Centromochlus</i>, and <i>Trachelyopterus</i>; species of the South-American family
  Characinidae; <i>Amblyopsis spelaea</i>, the blind Fish from the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky
  (Amblyopsidae); among the Syngnathidae, the short-snouted Sea-Horse (<i>Hippocampus
  brevirostris</i>) of the British Coasts; certain Sclerodermi, such as the Trigger-Fishes,
  <i>Batistes vetula</i>, <i>Triacanthus brevirostris</i>, <i>T. biaculeatus</i>, and <i>Monacanthus
  pardalis</i>, and also some "Coffer Fishes" (<i>e.g.</i> species of <i>Ostracion</i>); some
  Gymnodontes (species of <i>Diodon</i> and <i>Tetrodon</i>); a few Serranidae (<i>e.g.</i> species
  of <i>Therapon</i> and <i>Pristipoma</i>); species of <i>Holacanthus</i> (Chaetodontidae) and in
  <i>Holocentrum sogho</i> (Berycidae); such Sciaenidae as the "Drum" (<i>Pogonias chromis</i>), the
  "Maigre" (<i>Sciaena aquila</i>), which has sometimes been taken in British waters, <i>Umbrina
  cirrhosa</i>, <i>Otolithus regalis</i>, and <i>Micropogon undulatus</i>, and, with more or less
  probability, many other species of the same family; one species of Zeidae, the John Dory (<i>Zeus
  faber</i>); <i>Batrachus tau</i> among the Batrachidae; several species of Gurnards (Triglidae)
  belonging to the genera <i>Prionotus</i> and <i>Trigla</i>; the so-called Flying Gurnard,
  <i>Dactylopterus volitans</i> (Dactylopteridae); the Indian species <i>Ophiocephalus marulius</i>
  and <i>O. gachua</i> (Ophiocephalidae); amongst the Gadidae, the Cod (<i>Gadus morrhua</i>) and
  the Haddock (<i>G. aeglefinus</i>); in such Zoarcidae as the blind Fish (<i>Lucifuga
  subterranea</i>) from the subterranean waters of the caves of Cuba, and also in some Ophidiidae
  (<i>e.g.</i> species of <i>Ophidium</i>).</p>

  <p>In Fishes other than Teleosts, instances of normal sound-production by special vocal structures
  are rare. No recorded instances are known in the Cyclostomes or the Elasmobranchs,<a id="NtA_425"
  href="#Nt_425"><sup>[425]</sup></a> <span class="pagenum" id="page362"><span
  class="smaller">{362}</span></span>but there is evidence that sounds are emitted by
  <i>Polypterus</i> among the Crossopterygii, and by the Dipnoids <i>Neoceratodus</i>,<a
  id="NtA_426" href="#Nt_426"><sup>[426]</sup></a> <i>Protopterus</i>, and <i>Lepidosiren</i>,
  although it is not certainly known how they are produced, or that they may not be the accidental
  concomitants of the inspiratory or expiratory action of the lungs in breathing.</p>

  <p>As to the nature of the sounds produced by the air-bladder and its muscles in different
  Teleosts, a few examples may be given.</p>

  <p>The sound produced by the elastic-spring-apparatus of a recently caught <i>Doras maculatus</i>,
  has been described as a "deep growling tone," which may be distinctly heard at a distance of 100
  feet when the Fish is out of the water. Under like conditions the air-bladder and its muscles, in
  a species of <i>Platystoma</i>, emit a similar sound. On the other hand, the sound produced by the
  elastic springs of the Electric Siluroid (<i>Malopterurus electricus</i>) has been compared to the
  hissing of a cat. The Sea-Horse (<i>Hippocampus brevirostris</i>) utters a monotonous sound
  analogous to that of a tambour, which is characteristic of both sexes, but is more intense and
  frequent in the breeding season. The "Coffer Fish" (<i>Ostracion trigonus</i>) emits a growling
  sound, as also does the "Globe Fish" (<i>Tetrodon honckenii</i>) when taken out of the water.<a
  id="NtA_427" href="#Nt_427"><sup>[427]</sup></a> The air-bladder and its muscles in the "Drum"
  (<i>Pogonias chromis</i>), constitute the most powerful sound-producing organ yet found in any
  Fish. The sounds emitted by the "Drum" are better expressed by the word drumming than by any
  other, and have frequently been heard by persons in vessels lying at anchor on the coasts of the
  United States, where these Fishes abound.<a id="NtA_428" href="#Nt_428"><sup>[428]</sup></a> The
  "Drum" begins its drumming noise in the spawning season in April, but is rarely heard afterwards.
  The "Maigre" (<i>Sciaena aquila</i>), whose musical performances are perhaps responsible for the
  Homeric fable of the song of the Sirens, is remarkable among Fishes for the variety of its sounds,
  which have been compared to bellowing, purring, buzzing, and whistling.<a id="NtA_429"
  href="#Nt_429"><sup>[429]</sup></a> The sound is often so intense that it may be heard when the
  Fish is at a depth of 18 metres, and the <span class="pagenum" id="page363"><span
  class="smaller">{363}</span></span>ear of the observer two metres above the water; and it has been
  recorded that by listening for these sounds, shoals of Maigres have been successfully netted. They
  rarely emit sounds when isolated; but in shoals, during the breeding season, they do not cease to
  make sounds with a vigour and a persistency which apparently must soon wear out their strength.
  One of the Indian Horse-Mackerels (<i>Caranx hippos</i>) grunts like a young Pig when captured,
  and the sound is repeated whenever it is moved, as long as vitality remains. A West Indian species
  of the same family (<i>Argyriosus vomer</i>) has been observed to produce a like sound, while an
  Egyptian <i>Caranx</i> (<i>C. rhonchus</i>) is known to the Arabs as the "Chakoura" or
  "Snorter."<a id="NtA_430" href="#Nt_430"><sup>[430]</sup></a> The sounds produced by the different
  British Gurnards, such as the Grey Gurnard (<i>Trigla gurnardus</i>), the Piper (<i>T. lyra</i>),
  the Elleck or Cuckoo Gurnard (<i>T. cuculus</i>), and the Tub-Fish (<i>T. hirundo</i>), have been
  compared to snoring, a sonorous and prolonged grunting, crooning (whence, perhaps, the term
  "crooner," by which the Grey Gurnard is known in Ireland), and croaking. The John Dory (<i>Zeus
  faber</i>)<a id="NtA_431" href="#Nt_431"><sup>[431]</sup></a> also utters sounds analogous to
  those of the Gurnards. Among the Dipnoi <i>Lepidosiren</i> is said to make a growling sound, and
  <i>Neoceratodus</i> a grunting noise which may be heard at night for some distance.</p>

  <p>Whatever the nature of the vocal mechanism, it is highly probable that the sounds produced by
  Fishes travel to considerable distances in the water, inasmuch as the latter medium is a far
  better conductor of sound than air, and, moreover, the transmission of sound-vibrations from the
  air-bladder to the water is facilitated in many Fishes by the fact that, for a portion of its
  extent on each side the bladder is in direct contact with the superficial skin behind the pectoral
  girdle.</p>

  <p>From the by no means exhaustive list of examples given above, it is obvious that in some form
  or other vocal organs are present in a considerable number of Fishes, both freshwater and marine,
  belonging to widely different groups; and further, that even in the same species (e.g. <i>Doras
  maculatus</i> and other Siluridae), both stridulation and the action of extrinsic muscles on the
  air-bladder may be utilised as a means of sound-production. Certain Teleostean families like the
  Siluridae, the Sciaenidae, and the Triglidae, seem to be distinguished above all others by the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page364"><span class="smaller">{364}</span></span>prevalence of some
  form of vocal organ. According to S&ouml;rensen, the first mentioned of the three families includes no
  less than 68 species, which utilise the air-bladder alone as a sound-producing organ.
  Nevertheless, there still remain many Teleostean families, rich in genera and species, and with an
  almost world-wide geographical distribution, in which such organs have not yet been found.</p>

  <p>The advantages which Fishes derive from the possession of sound-producing organs are
  sufficiently obvious.</p>

  <p>A characteristic feature in the reproduction of most Fishes is the general absence of any
  process of conjugation between the sexes, the eggs being fertilised in the water after their
  extrusion from the body of the female, and, consequently, any device which will facilitate the
  formation of shoals during the breeding season must be of great advantage to the species by
  largely increasing the chances that the ova will be fertilised, and thus secure the more
  successful propagation of the race. Hence it may be concluded that the vocal organs of Fishes are
  a means to this end, and that the sounds they produce are in fact recognition-sounds which enable
  Fishes of the same species to congregate together at periods when reproductive activity is
  greatest. This view is in harmony with much that is known of the habits of these Fishes,
  especially with the fact that particular sounds are often characteristic of particular species,
  and that the sounds are produced most frequently and with greater intensity during the breeding
  season than at any other time. While useful to all Fishes that possess them, vocal organs are, no
  doubt, specially serviceable to those Fishes which, from the nature of their habitat, can make but
  little use of their eyes; and this fact may perhaps explain the prevalence of such organs in the
  Siluridae, which are frequently bottom- or ground-feeding Fishes, and often live in muddy
  waters.</p>

  <p>The sounds emitted by Fishes may also, in some instances at least, be warning sounds. Many of
  the sound-producing Fishes are provided with exceptionally strong spines either in connexion with
  the median and paired fins, as in many Siluridae, or on the general surface of the body, as in
  <i>Diodon hystrix</i>. Such spines are very effective weapons for offensive or defensive purposes,
  and are capable of inflicting very severe wounds. The natural enemies of these Fishes learn by
  experience or instinct to <span class="pagenum" id="page365"><span
  class="smaller">{365}</span></span>associate particular sounds with the possession of dangerous
  spines, and warned by the sounds, they refrain from attacking the owner of the spines, to the
  mutual advantage of both.</p>

  <p class="sp5"><b>Electric Organs.</b>&mdash;Electric organs capable of generating more or less
  powerful electric discharges are present in certain Fishes, both marine and freshwater. They occur
  in a few Elasmobranchs (species of <i>Raia</i>, <i>Torpedo</i>, and <i>Hypnos</i>), in such
  Teleosts as the African Silurid <i>Malopterurus</i> the "Electric Eel" (<i>Gymnotus</i>), and in
  species of Mormyridae (e.g. <i>Mormyrus</i>). With one exception electric organs are composed of
  metamorphosed muscular fibres, and their nerve-endings or motor end-plates. The species of
  <i>Raia</i> have two small electric organs, one on each side of the terminal portion of the
  tail.<a id="NtA_432" href="#Nt_432"><sup>[432]</sup></a> In <i>Gymnotus</i><a id="NtA_433"
  href="#Nt_433"><sup>[433]</sup></a> the <span class="pagenum" id="page366"><span
  class="smaller">{366}</span></span>organs are much larger, and extend the whole length of the
  tail, which is fully four-fifths of the total length of the Fish. The Mormyridae also have their
  feeble electric organs in the caudal region. In all these Fishes the electric organs are modified
  portions of the caudal muscles. In the Torpedo, however, these organs are two large oval masses,
  one on each side of the head, between the gills and the cephalic prolongation of the pectoral fin
  (Fig. 209). <i>Malopterurus</i><a id="NtA_434" href="#Nt_434"><sup>[434]</sup></a> is exceptional
  in possessing an electric organ derived from the epidermis and not from the muscular system. In
  this Fish the organ envelops nearly the whole body like a mantle, between the skin and the
  subjacent muscles of the trunk and tail. An electric organ is composed of an immense number of
  "electric plates" (modified motor end-plates), abundantly supplied with nerves on one of their
  surfaces, and disposed in a series of vertical (<i>Torpedo</i>) or longitudinal (<i>Gymnotus</i>)
  columns, separated by septa of connective tissue. In the active state of the organ in the
  Torpedo<a id="NtA_435" href="#Nt_435"><sup>[435]</sup></a> the ventral surfaces of the plates, on
  which the nerves are distributed, become negative to the dorsal, and "the effect in all the plates
  of a column when summed up is, therefore, such that the dorsal end of a column becomes positive to
  the ventral end."<a id="NtA_436" href="#Nt_436"><sup>[436]</sup></a> Hence the current in the form
  of a succession of shocks passes from the ventral to the dorsal surface of the head. In
  <i>Gymnotus</i>, where the columns are longitudinally arranged, it is the anterior and posterior
  surfaces which become oppositely electrified, and the current passes from the tail to the head.
  The shock imparted by an electric discharge is most powerful in <i>Gymnotus</i>,<a id="NtA_437"
  href="#Nt_437"><sup>[437]</sup></a> <i>Malopterurus</i>, and <i>Torpedo</i>, in the order named,
  and relatively weak in the remaining genera. The strength of the shock increases with the number
  of electric plates included in the circuit. Thus in <i>Gymnotus</i> the maximum shock is given
  when the body of the Fish is so curved that the head and the tail are in contact with different
  points on the surface of some other Fish. The discharge may be reflex or voluntary. Repeated
  discharges induce fatigue and weaken the shocks. Electric organs are powerful offensive or
  defensive structures, enabling the Fish to repel the attacks of enemies, or to stun or kill their
  prey.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="smaller">NERVOUS SYSTEM AND ORGANS OF
  SPECIAL SENSE</span></p>

  <p>The nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord, and of the cranial and spinal
  nerves. The rudiment of the future brain and spinal cord first appears in the embryos of some
  Cyclostomes (e.g. <i>Bdellostoma</i>), of Elasmobranchs, and of Chondrostei (e.g.
  <i>Acipenser</i>), and of <i>Neoceratodus</i> among the Dipnoi, in the form of a tubular medullary
  canal pinched off from the epiblast of the dorsal surface of the body. By a somewhat different
  method, but with the same final result, a medullary canal is formed in other Cyclostomes (e.g.
  <i>Petromyzon</i>), in the Holostei and Teleostei, and in <i>Lepidosiren</i>,<a id="NtA_438"
  href="#Nt_438"><sup>[438]</sup></a> from a solid ingrowing keel of epiblast which subsequently
  becomes tubular. Later, the medullary canal in the head enlarges, and becomes divided by two
  transverse constrictions into three vesicles, the primary fore-, mid-, and hind-brain, leaving the
  rest of the canal to form the spinal cord.</p>

  <p><b>The Spinal Cord.</b>&mdash;This portion of the medullary canal retains a simpler and more
  uniform cylindrical structure. Its walls thicken and their component cells become converted into
  nerve cells and nerve fibres, but a remnant of the original cavity remains in the adult as a
  minute axial canal, with a ciliated epithelial lining, the central canal of the spinal cord or
  myelocoele. In most Fishes the spinal cord extends the whole length of the body, but in some
  Teleosts, especially in certain Plectognathi, it is remarkably short. In a Sun-Fish
  (<i>Orthagoriscus</i>), 2&frac12; metres long, and weighing about a ton and a half, the cord was only 15
  mm. in length, or shorter than the brain.</p>

  <p><b>The Brain.</b>&mdash;At an early stage in its embryonic history the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page368"><span class="smaller">{368}</span></span>brain consists of three simple vesicles, the
  <i>fore</i>-, the <i>mid</i>-, and the <i>hind-brain</i>, the first of which lies in front of the
  anterior end of the notochord and is therefore pre-chordal in position. As development proceeds
  the walls of the vesicles undergo local thickenings, or they give rise to hollow paired or median
  outgrowths, and by one or other of these methods the different parts of the complex adult brain
  are evolved, while the original cavities of the vesicles or of their outgrowths persist as a
  continuous system of epithelium-lined spaces or "ventricles."<a id="NtA_439"
  href="#Nt_439"><sup>[439]</sup></a> The fore-brain is remarkable for the number and importance of
  the parts to which it gives rise. First, it bulges out in front into a hollow vesicle, the
  <i>prosencephalon</i>, leaving the rest of the fore-brain as the <i>thalamencephalon</i> or
  <i>diencephalon</i> (Fig. 210). The cavity of the prosencephalon is the <i>prosocoele</i>, and a
  pair of thickenings in its floor form two basal ganglia or <i>corpora striata</i>. In many Fishes
  the prosencephalon retains this simple vesicular condition, in which case the roof or
  <i>pallium</i> is usually epithelial and non-nervous; but in others two hollow lobes grow out from
  it in front and give rise to two <i>cerebral hemispheres</i> or <i>parencephala</i>.<a
  id="NtA_440" href="#Nt_440"><sup>[440]</sup></a> Both contain extensions of the prosocoele, the
  <i>paracoeles</i> or <i>lateral ventricles</i>, from the floor of which the corpora striata now
  project. The prolongation of the pallium forming the roof of the lateral ventricles either remains
  partially epithelial, or it may acquire a wholly nervous structure and thicken to an extent which
  differs greatly in different Fishes. With the formation of the hemispheres the prosencephalon and
  its prosocoele become of secondary importance, and may cease to be recognisable as distinct from
  the thalamencephalon and its ventricle. The lateral ventricles then appear to communicate directly
  with the third ventricle by two apertures, the <i>foramina of Munro</i>. The forward growth of the
  brain is completed by the development of two hollow lobes, the <i>olfactory lobes</i> or
  <i>rhinencephala</i>, each of which contains a ventricle or <i>rhinocoele</i> communicating behind
  with the prosocoele, or, if hemispheres are present, with the corresponding lateral ventricle.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Scarcely less complicated, and perhaps even more interesting from a morphological standpoint,
  are the structures arising out of the thalamencephalon. By thickenings of its lateral walls two
  large ganglia, the <i>optic thalami</i>, are formed, and on the inner or dorsal aspect of each of
  these a <i>ganglion habenulae</i> is developed. From the sides of the thalamencephalon the primary
  <i>optic vesicles</i> are derived, which later become transformed into the retinal parts of the
  paired eyes and the optic nerves. Besides the optic vesicles there is a second pair of embryonic
  outgrowths which arise from the roof of the thalamencephalon. These outgrowths form stalked
  vesicles and represent a pair of degenerate visual <span class="pagenum" id="page370"><span
  class="smaller">{370}</span></span>organs. Usually they become so displaced that the left one lies
  in front of the right, and they appear as if median. The subsequent fate of the vesicles differs
  greatly in different Craniates. Both persist in the Lamprey, the right vesicle to some extent
  retaining its primitive visual function as a <i>parietal eye</i> and directly overlying the left
  or pineal vesicle. In Elasmobranchs the two unite to form a glandular organ, the so-called
  <i>pineal body</i> of the adult, and in Teleosts the left vesicle disappears, leaving the right as
  a pineal body.<a id="NtA_441" href="#Nt_441"><sup>[441]</sup></a> There is also an embryonic
  median outgrowth from the roof of the prosencephalon, the <i>paraphysis</i>, which soon disappears
  and whose significance is not known. A median hollow downgrowth from the floor of the
  thalamencephalon forms the <i>infundibulum</i>, which becomes attached to a caecal diverticulum
  from the roof of the mouth. With rare exceptions the diverticulum loses all connexion with the
  mouth, and, as the <i>pituitary body</i> or <i>hypophysis</i>, it appears as an appendage to the
  extremity of the infundibulum. In the Crossopterygii the connexion is retained even in the adult
  by means of a slender canal extending from the pituitary body and opening into the oral cavity.
  Laterally, the base of the infundibulum grows out into a pair of rounded lobes, the <i>lobi
  inferiores</i>, and distally into a thin-walled glandular sac, the <i>saccus vasculosus</i>, which
  lies just behind the pituitary body. The cavity of the thalamencephalon persists as the <i>third
  ventricle</i> or <i>diacoele</i>. The parts of the brain developed from the mid-brain and the
  hind-brain are much less complicated, and, except for variations in size, they present a fairly
  uniform character in most Fishes.</p>

  <p>In the mid-brain the roof bulges out into a pair of <i>optic lobes</i>, and by the growth of
  lateral thickenings in its floor two thick strands of longitudinally disposed nerve fibres, the
  <i>crura cerebri</i>, are formed. The cavity of the mid-brain remains as the <i>mesocoele</i>, and
  from it an extension may be prolonged into each optic lobe.</p>

  <p>From the hind-brain are formed the <i>cerebellum</i> or <i>epencephalon</i> and the <i>medulla
  oblongata</i> or <i>metencephalon</i>, the former as a dorsal bulging, the latter as a ventral
  thickening. Except where the cerebellum is developed the dorsal wall remains epithelial, and forms
  the roof of the persistent cavity of the <span class="pagenum" id="page371"><span
  class="smaller">{371}</span></span>hind-brain, the <i>fourth ventricle</i> or <i>metacoele</i>,
  which retains its primitive continuity with the central canal of the spinal cord. Lateral
  lobe-like outgrowths from the dorsal columns of the medulla are conspicuous structures in some
  Fishes, and are known as <i>corpora restiformia</i>. The paired portions of the brain are
  connected across the middle line by a series of <i>transverse commissures</i>. The more important
  modifications of the brain in Cyclostomes and Fishes will now be briefly dealt with.</p>

  <p>In the Cyclostome <i>Petromyzon</i> there is a small prosencephalon with an undivided
  prosocoele, and on each side of it a small cerebral hemisphere which appears as a mere appendage
  to the much larger olfactory lobe (Fig. 211). The prosocoele divides in front into two outwardly
  directed branches, and of the two diverticula into which each branch divides one extends as a
  lateral ventricle into the hemisphere of its side, and the other as a rhinocoele into the
  corresponding olfactory lobe. The ganglia habenulae are unusually large, the right one being
  larger than the left. The optic lobes are large, but not obviously double. So small is the
  cerebellum that it seems to be little more than a narrow transverse band crossing the fore-part of
  the fourth ventricle. The roof of the brain is largely epithelial, especially in the
  prosencephalon, the thalamencephalon, and the hind-brain. Over these epithelial areas the pia
  mater is unusually vascular and forms a series of "choroid plexuses." The ventricular system is
  complete and continuous. By contrast with the Lamprey the brain of <i>Myxine</i><a id="NtA_442"
  href="#Nt_442"><sup>[442]</sup></a> is very primitive, more so perhaps than in any other Craniate
  (Fig. 212). In a dorsal view the brain is divided into four pairs of laterally expanded and
  longitudinally compressed lobes by a median longitudinal fissure and three transverse fissures.
  The two anterior lobes are little more than the thickened anterior wall of the thalamencephalon,
  although, judging from their histological structure, they represent a very imperfectly
  differentiated prosencephalon and olfactory lobes. The second and largest pair constitute the
  thalamencephalon. The last two pairs of lobes represent a transversely divided pair of optic
  lobes, or "corpora quadrigemina." There is a large medulla oblongata with a pair of corpora
  restiformia, but the <span class="pagenum" id="page373"><span
  class="smaller">{373}</span></span>cerebellum is entirely absent. The ventricles are subject to
  some individual variation. Third and fourth ventricles are generally recognisable, either as
  isolated cavities or connected by a remnant of the mesocoele. In the feeble development of the
  prosencephalon, in the striking preponderance of the mid-brain over the rest of the brain, and in
  the absence of a cerebellum, <i>Myxine</i> is unique amongst Craniates.</p>

  <p>In Elasmobranchs among Fishes the brain attains a much higher grade of structure. In
  <i>Scyllium</i> (Fig. 213) there is a large prosencephalon, and directly in front of it a pair of
  imperfectly differentiated cerebral hemispheres, while from its antero-lateral regions the large
  olfactory lobes arise. The prosocoele divides in front into four diverticula, of which the two
  <span class="pagenum" id="page374"><span class="smaller">{374}</span></span>inner ones extend into
  the hemispheres as lateral ventricles, and the two outer as rhinocoeles into the olfactory lobes
  (Fig. 214). In connexion with the infundibulum there is a pair of sacci vasculosi, consisting
  mainly of gland-tubules, opening into the infundibular cavity.<a id="NtA_443"
  href="#Nt_443"><sup>[443]</sup></a> The cerebellum is exceptionally large, but it does not form a
  "valvula cerebelli." Large ear-like corpora restiformia are present. The third and fourth
  ventricles alone retain an epithelial roof in relation with choroid plexuses.</p>

  <p>In all essentials the brain of the Holocephali is a repetition of the Elasmobranch type, more
  especially of the elongated form seen in <i>Notidanus</i>. Indications of a higher grade of
  structure are, however, to be seen in the reduction of the prosencephalon which, with its
  prosocoele, is now scarcely distinguishable from the thalamencephalon and its ventricle; and in
  the more complete differentiation of the cerebral hemispheres from one another and from the rest
  of the brain. Large frilled corpora restiformia are conspicuous structures on each side of the
  medulla oblongata. Besides the usual intra-cranial pituitary body, there is also a separate
  extra-cranial portion lodged in a pit on the ventral surface of the basis cranii: in the embryo
  the two are continuous.</p>

  <p>The most obvious feature in the brain of the Dipnoi is the great development of the cerebral
  hemispheres. In this respect these Fishes approach the Amphibia, but in other features of
  brain-structure they present points of agreement with most other groups of Fishes without being
  closely related to any one of them. In <i>Protopterus</i><a id="NtA_446"
  href="#Nt_446"><sup>[446]</sup></a> (Fig. 217) the hemispheres are quite distinct except behind,
  and the walls of their spacious lateral ventricles are entirely nervous. Olfactory lobes are
  sessile on their anterior extremities, and behind and below they enlarge into ventral lobes which
  probably represent the hippocampal lobes of the higher Vertebrates. A vesicular pineal body at the

  <p>The optic lobes form a single oval body, and, as in <i>Petromyzon</i> and the Amphibia, the
  cerebellum is very small. A posterior choroid plexus covers the roof of the fourth ventricle, and
  an anterior plexus in connexion with the roof of the thalamencephalon projects downwards into the
  third ventricle, and is also prolonged forwards into each lateral ventricle. In
  <i>Neoceratodus</i><a id="NtA_447" href="#Nt_447"><sup>[447]</sup></a> the brain is certainly more
  primitive and distinctly less Amphibian. As compared with <i>Protopterus</i> the olfactory lobes
  and the cerebellum are larger, and the optic lobes are paired. The smaller hemispheres are <span
  class="pagenum" id="page378"><span class="smaller">{378}</span></span>non-nervous dorsally and
  medianly, the roof and inner wall of each being formed by an extension of the thick, glandular
  choroid plexus which forms the roof of the thalamencephalon.</p>

  <p><b>The Spinal Nerves.</b>&mdash;The spinal nerves of Cyclostomes (e.g. <i>Petromyzon</i>)
  consist of a series of dorsal nerves arising on each side from the dorsal surface of the spinal
  cord, and of a similar double series arising from the ventral surface, the dorsal nerves regularly
  alternating with the ventral nerves. Each myotome is supplied by a dorsal and a ventral nerve
  which pass separately to their peripheral distribution in the skin and muscles. In Fishes, as in
  the higher Vertebrates, each dorsal nerve, now termed a dorsal root, enlarges into a ganglion and
  then unites, either before or directly after issuing from the neural canal, with the next ventral
  nerve or ventral root in front to form a main spinal nerve. At the same time the spinal nerves of
  opposite sides tend to form pairs in the same transverse plane. After the union of the two roots
  the spinal nerve divides into three typical branches: a dorsal nerve (ramus dorsalis), and a
  ventral nerve (ramus ventralis), both of which include somatic sensory or afferent fibres, and
  somatic motor or efferent fibres, for the innervation of the skin and muscles of the dorsal and
  lateral portions of a myotome; and a visceral branch (ramus visceralis), composed of afferent and
  efferent visceral fibres, which supplies the adjacent viscera (alimentary canal and its glands and
  blood-vessels), and helps to form the sympathetic nervous system.<a id="NtA_448"
  href="#Nt_448"><sup>[448]</sup></a> The somatic afferent and the visceral afferent fibres enter
  the spinal cord by the dorsal roots, the somatic efferent leaving the cord through the ventral
  roots, although the visceral efferent fibres traverse both roots. In the region of the paired fins
  more or fewer of the rami ventrales unite to form a plexus, the brachial or the pelvic plexus,
  from which the nerves to the fins take their origin.</p>

  <p><b>The Cranial Nerves.</b>&mdash;It is usual to describe the cranial nerves of Cyclostomes and
  Fishes as consisting of ten serially disposed pairs, viz.: the <i>olfactory</i> (i.), <i>optic</i>
  (ii.), <i>oculomotor</i> (iii.), <i>trochlear</i> (iv.), <i>trigeminal</i> (v.), <i>abducens</i>
  (vi.), <i>facial</i> (vii.), <i>auditory</i> (viii.), <i>glossopharyngeal</i> (ix.), and the
  <i>vagus</i> (x.) Like the spinal nerves, the cranial nerves collectively include somatic sensory
  (general cutaneous) and motor fibres, and also visceral sensory <span class="pagenum"
  id="page379"><span class="smaller">{379}</span></span>and motor fibres, all of which have their
  own special centres in the brain, but the proportions of these nerve components differ greatly in
  different nerves. Certain preoral nerves (iii., iv., and vi.) are exclusively somatic motor;
  others (i. and ii.) are special sensory nerves for the olfactory and visual organs; but most of
  the other cranial nerves include several components, and are therefore "mixed" nerves. Besides
  these components some cranial nerves include also a quasi-independent system of nerve-fibres,
  which converge from certain cutaneous sense-organs to an independent centre in the medulla
  oblongata, the <i>tuber acusticum</i>,<a id="NtA_449" href="#Nt_449"><sup>[449]</sup></a> and is
  probably derived from the general cutaneous system of nerve components. Such nerve fibres,
  including also the auditory nerve, which has its origin from the same centre, constitute the
  <i>lateralis system</i>. Perhaps the most striking feature in the postoral cranial nerves is the
  predominance of the visceralis or sympathetic system over the somatic. Omitting the lateralis
  fibres and a relatively few somatic sensory fibres, visceral fibres, sensory and motor, are the
  principal components of all these nerves, including v. but excluding viii. The reason for this is
  to be found in the fact that splanchnic or visceral muscles in relation with the jaws and
  branchial arches have usurped the place of somatic muscles in the muscular system of the head. For
  developmental and other reasons the olfactory and optic nerves stand in a category of their own,
  and the same may be said of the third, fourth, and sixth nerves, which innervate the muscles of
  the eyeball. The remaining nerves, all of which have their origin in the medulla oblongata,
  possess certain features in common, and as they are related to the gill-clefts in such a way that
  each forks over a cleft, they may be conveniently distinguished as "<i>branchial</i>" or
  "<i>branchiomeric nerves</i>." A typical branchial nerve consists of (1) a <i>principal
  ganglion</i> near the origin of the nerve from the brain; (2) a <i>main trunk</i> which gives off
  (3) a somatic sensory branch or <i>dorsal nerve</i> to the skin; (4) a <i>palatine nerve</i>
  (visceral sensory) to the oral or pharyngeal mucous membrane; (5) an <i>epibranchial ganglion</i>
  which is associated with a transitory embryonic <i>epibranchial sensory organ</i> at the dorsal
  border of a branchial cleft; (6) a <i>pre-branchial</i> nerve (visceral sensory), skirting the
  anterior margin of a cleft in its ventral course; and (7) a <i>post-branchial</i> branch (visceral
  motor) similarly related to the hinder margin.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The first six cranial nerves resemble those of the higher Craniates in their mode
  of origin from the brain, in the physiological nature of their component fibres, and in their
  peripheral distribution, and therefore they need not be specially referred to here. The principal
  branches of the fifth or <i>trigeminal</i> nerve are shown in Fig. 218. Comparing this nerve with
  a typical branchial nerve it would seem that the <i>profundus</i> and <i>superficialis ophthalmic
  nerves</i> are dorsal nerves; the <i>maxillaris</i> and <i>mandibularis</i>, pre- and
  post-branchial branches, respectively, in relation with the modified gill-cleft which forms the
  mouth, while the branch to the oral surface represents a <i>palatine</i> nerve. The most important
  of the distinctive features in the cranial nerves of Fishes are to be found in the relations of
  nerves vii., ix., and x. to branchial clefts, and in the lateralis system of nerve components and
  its association with the lateral line sensory organs. The seventh or <i>facial</i> nerve is an
  exceptionally interesting nerve. Besides the usual components of a typical branchial nerve certain
  of its so-called branches are wholly or largely derived from the lateralis system. For this reason
  the nerve may be said to consist of two portions, the <i>facial proper</i>, or those fibres which
  constitute the facial nerve in air-breathing Craniates, and the <i>lateralis branches</i> which
  solely innervate lateral line sense-organs, and are therefore peculiar to aquatic forms. The
  facial proper has a ganglion (<i>the facial or geniculate ganglion</i>) on its root, and on
  entering the orbit after traversing the cranial wall it gives off a <i>palatine</i> nerve. Just
  over the spiracle a <i>pre-branchial</i> nerve, the representative of the <i>chorda tympani</i> of
  Mammals, leaves the main trunk, and passes ventrally in relation with the anterior wall of the
  spiracle to its ultimate distribution in the walls of the mouth cavity. The main trunk, now called
  the <i>ramus hyomandibularis</i>, then pursues a ventral course behind the spiracle as a
  post-branchial nerve, and certain of its mainly motor branches which pass downwards in connexion
  with the hyoid arch supply the muscles of that arch, and, if an operculum is present, the
  opercular muscles as well. The lateralis portion of the facial includes the following principal
  branches, <span class="pagenum" id="page382"><span class="smaller">{382}</span></span>each of
  which may have a ganglion on its root: (1) an <i>ophthalmicus superficialis</i>; (2) a <i>buccalis
  nerve</i> with its <i>ramus oticus</i>; and (3) <i>external mandibular</i> nerves which course in
  the ramus hyomandibularis. The addition of the great <i>lateralis</i> nerve, which is usually
  described as the lateral branch of the tenth nerve, and of the eighth or <i>auditory</i> nerve
  which supplies the auditory organ, completes the enumeration of the main factors of the lateralis
  system. The ninth or <i>glosso-pharyngeal</i> nerve, perhaps the most typical of all the branchial
  nerves, has pre- and post-branchial branches which enclose the hyo-branchial cleft. Its palatine
  nerve usually extends forwards and anastomoses with the corresponding branch of the seventh, thus
  forming a connexion (<i>Jacobson's anastomosis</i>) between the two cranial nerves. In some
  Elasmobranchs and Teleosts fibres derived from the dorsal branch of the ninth nerve innervate a
  few sense-organs of the lateral sensory canal of the head, and hence that nerve sometimes contains
  lateralis fibres. The tenth or <i>vagus</i> is a compound nerve. Besides the great lateralis nerve
  generally associated with it, the <i>vagus</i> includes as many typical branchial nerves as there
  are branchial clefts behind the hyo-branchial cleft, and in Elasmobranchs and in <i>Chimaera</i>
  these nerves have independent origins from the medulla oblongata. Each nerve has the typical
  structure, a ganglionated trunk which forks over a gill-cleft into the usual pre- and
  post-branchial branches, and palatine branches to the pharyngeal walls. In the Dipnoi the
  lateralis nerve is connected with the superficial ophthalmic branch of the seventh nerve by a
  commisural nerve which curves across the outer face of the auditory capsule. A somewhat similar
  anastomosis is also present in <i>Petromyzon</i>. The <i>vagus</i> also includes a large <i>ramus
  intestinalis</i>, which in Elasmobranchs, at all events, has a distinct ganglionated root. The
  nerve forms characteristic plexuses on the oesophagus and stomach, and in Cyclostomes its branches
  may extend nearly the whole length of the intestine. In Ganoids and Teleosts there is an
  interesting nerve known as the "<i>lateralis accessorius</i>." It is a compound nerve, and owes
  its formation to the union of somatic sensory fibres derived in succession from dorsal branches of
  the v., vii., ix., and x. nerves, and also from the corresponding branches of a variable number of
  spinal nerves. The finer branches of the nerve are distributed to the skin of one or more of the
  fins, or <span class="pagenum" id="page383"><span class="smaller">{383}</span></span>even, as in
  <i>Gadus</i>, to all the fins, especially to the numerous "end-buds" which are present on those
  organs. In many Fishes a variable number of the anterior spinal nerves (<i>spino-occipital</i>)
  perforate the occipital region of the skull. They probably represent the ventral roots only of the
  ordinary spinal nerves of this region.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Sense-Organs</span></p>

  <p><b>The Cutaneous Sense-Organs.</b>&mdash;These organs, the most remarkable and certainly the
  most characteristic of the sense-organs of Cyclostomes and Fishes, are bud-like groups of
  epidermic cells in relation with the ends of sensory nerve fibres. Each consists of a central core
  of sensory cells, provided with terminal cuticular sensory hairs, and surrounded by a zone of
  supporting and mucus-secreting cells which leave the hairs exposed at the apex of the bud. Two
  kinds of these organs can be distinguished, which differ in their innervation and in their
  position in the skin. Of the two, the so-called <i>end-buds</i> are the more primitive. They
  occupy a superficial position in the epidermis, and their sense-cells are as long as the
  supporting cells. They are present in Cyclostomes and Elasmobranchs, and especially in Teleosts,
  where they are irregularly distributed over the surface of the body, on the fins, lips, and
  barbels, and also in the epithelium of the mouth and pharynx. In the Dipnoi they are limited to
  the oral cavity, and in the higher Craniates they become taste-buds.<a id="NtA_450"
  href="#Nt_450"><sup>[450]</sup></a> Their somatic sensory nerves<a id="NtA_451"
  href="#Nt_451"><sup>[451]</sup></a> are derived from the vii., ix., and x. cranial nerves, and the
  lateralis accessorius. In the second type, usually called "<i>nerve-eminences</i>," the sensory
  cells are shorter than the supporting cells, and they are always innervated by the lateralis
  system. When first developed in the embryo they are quite superficial, like end-buds, but later
  the epidermis in which they lie sinks inwards so as to line a series of pits, closed sacs, tubes,
  open grooves, or closed canals. <i>Pit-organs</i>, so abundant on the head and trunk of Teleosts
  (Fig. 220), are simple epidermic pits with insunken nerve-eminences, disposed in groups or in
  <span class="pagenum" id="page384"><span class="smaller">{384}</span></span>lines (accessory
  lateral lines) or irregularly distributed. The "<i>Spalt-papillen</i>" of Elasmobranchs are
  pit-organs in which the orifice of the pit is reduced to a slit. The more deeply-seated <i>Savi's
  vesicles</i> on the ventral surface of the Torpedo, and the <i>nerve-sacs</i> of Ganoids, are
  similar organs converted into closed sacs and pinched off from the rest of the epidermis.
  <i>Lorenzini's ampullae</i> or mucus canals, which are found in definitely located groups on the
  lateral and upper surfaces of the head in Elasmobranchs, may perhaps be compared to pit-organs
  prolonged inwards to form subcutaneous tubes, each of which terminates in a radially-septate,
  chambered dilatation or ampulla, containing groups of sensory cells.</p>

  <p>Besides the more diffusely scattered sense-organs there are others which become disposed in
  definite lines along the sides of the body and on the head, and, enclosed in grooves or closed
  canals, constitute the highly characteristic <i>lateral line system</i> of Cyclostomes and
  Fishes.<a id="NtA_452" href="#Nt_452"><sup>[452]</sup></a> The auditory organ must also be
  included as a specialised portion of this system. Both organs are innervated by the lateralis
  system, and both arise from a common rudiment in the embryonic epidermis in the position of the
  future auditory organ. This rudiment grows backwards along the side of the body in the form of a
  cord of cells differentiated from the epidermis, and also forwards, where it soon divides into the
  rudiments of future supra-orbital and infra-orbital canals. Sense-organs are differentiated at
  intervals along the line of the cord; and in the body, but not on the head, they frequently
  exhibit a segmental disposition. Each sensory organ then sinks down into a short epidermic groove,
  which by the subsequent meeting of its lips becomes a canal detached from the epidermis. The short
  canals then become continuous, leaving, however, an externally opening primary pore between every
  two consecutive canals, and the result is a continuous canal having sense-organs imbedded in its
  epidermic lining and connected with the exterior by pores at intervals (Fig. 219).<a id="NtA_453"
  href="#Nt_453"><sup>[453]</sup></a> The enclosure of the canals in the scales of the lateral line
  of the trunk or in special drain-pipe ossicles on the head, and the dichotomous subdivision of the
  primary pores into groups of surface-pores, complete the evolution of the system in its more
  advanced condition.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Typically, the lateral line system consists of certain canals or grooves, usually but not
  invariably continuous, and defined by their innervation, (i.) a <i>lateral canal</i> extending
  along the side of the body and the hinder part of the head, and having its sensory organs supplied
  by the great lateralis nerve (Fig. 220); (ii.) a <i>supra-orbital canal</i> passing forwards over
  the eye and innervated by the superficial ophthalmic branch of the facial nerve; (iii.) an
  <i>infra-orbital canal</i> supplied by the buccalis and otic branches of the same nerve; and (iv.)
  a <i>hyo-mandibular</i> or <i>operculo-mandibular canal</i>, situated on the outer side of the
  hyoid region, and thence prolonged downward and forward in relation with the lower jaw, and
  innervated by the external mandibular branches of the facial nerve. The hyo-mandibular canal is
  sometimes distinct from the other canals, as in Elasmobranchs and some Teleosts (Fig. 220); and in
  certain North American Siluroids the same may be said of the supra-orbital. But, as a rule, the
  infra-orbital is continuous behind both with the lateral and the supra-orbital canals, while the
  hyo-mandibular canal joins the infra-orbital, or, exceptionally, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page386"><span class="smaller">{386}</span></span>the supra-orbital canal. Transverse
  commissural canals often connect the lateral and supra-orbital canals of opposite sides across the
  dorsal surface of the head, and the corresponding infra-orbital and hyo-mandibular canals may also
  be continuous at the extremity of the snout or at the mandibular symphysis.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Throughout their extent the canals communicate with the exterior by pores, or short canals
  terminating in pores, or by branched canals ending in groups of pores. In Cyclostomes<a
  id="NtA_454" href="#Nt_454"><sup>[454]</sup></a> the lateral line system is represented by
  pit-organs disposed as in Fishes, and innervated by a true lateralis nerve. Some Elasmobranchs
  have the lateral canal of the trunk represented by an open groove protected by marginal denticles.
  <i>Chimaera</i> is more primitive still in this respect, for on the head as well as on the body
  the sensory organs are in open grooves. Amongst Fishes these organs are most primitive in the
  Dipnoi, where they retain their superficial position in the epidermis. In Teleostomes the lateral
  canals perforate the scales of the lateral line, and at intervals they open externally by simple
  or multiple pores which perforate the scales. On the head they are more or less completely
  enclosed in special ossicles which either remain distinct or fuse with certain of the adjacent
  dermal or cartilage bones of the skull. The use of the lateral line organs is not certainly known.
  They occur only in Fishes and Amphibia, and as blind Fishes are able to avoid obstacles with the
  greatest ease when swimming, it is possible that these organs enable their possessors <span
  class="pagenum" id="page387"><span class="smaller">{387}</span></span>to appreciate undulatory
  movements in water in the shape of reflex waves from contiguous surfaces or objects.<a
  id="NtA_455" href="#Nt_455"><sup>[455]</sup></a> Their great antiquity is shown by their existence
  in most of the Heterostraci, and in the Antiarchi and Arthrodira, although they have not yet been
  discovered in the Osteostraci.</p>

  <p><b>The Auditory Organs</b>.&mdash;In its more typical condition each auditory organ consists of
  a membranous sac or vestibule, partially constricted into an upper portion or utriculus and a
  lower or sacculus (Fig. 221, A). Three semicircular canals are connected with the utriculus, of
  which two are vertical and at right angles to one another, and the third is horizontal. One end of
  each canal is dilated into an ampulla. A slender tube, the ductus endolymphaticus, leaves the
  sacculus, and ends in a sac-like swelling, the sinus endolymphaticus, which apparently represents
  a portion of the embryonic epidermic involution from which the auditory organ is formed. A smaller
  sac-like outgrowth from the sacculus, the <i>lagena</i>, corresponds to the cochlea of the higher
  Vertebrates. The epidermic lining of this system of cavities is differentiated into patches or
  ridges of sense-cells (maculae or cristae), separated by supporting cells and innervated by the
  terminal branches of the auditory nerve. There is a crista acustica in each ampulla; and maculae
  acusticae are present in the utriculus, sacculus, and lagena. A fluid, the <i>endolymph</i>, fills
  all the cavities, and a similar fluid or <i>perilymph</i> occupies the spaces in the periotic
  capsule in which the various chambers are lodged. Among the more notable deviations from this type
  of auditory organ the Cyclostome <i>Myxine</i>, apparently, has but a single semicircular canal
  with an ampulla at each end, and the vestibule is a simple sac (Fig. 221, B). <i>Petromyzon</i>
  has two canals, but lacks the horizontal canal. In Elasmobranchs, including <i>Chimaera</i> (C),
  the ductus endolymphaticus retains its primitive connexion with the exterior by means of a pore on
  the dorsal surface of the head. In the Dipnoi (e.g. <i>Protopterus</i>) the paired endolymphatic
  sinuses divide into a number of caecal branches containing otoliths, which meet and interlace over
  the fourth ventricle (Fig. 217).<a id="NtA_456" href="#Nt_456"><sup>[456]</sup></a> Otoliths,

  <p>In a few marine and in a large number of freshwater Teleosts the auditory organ enters into a

  <p>The first and simplest is by the apposition of the extremities of a pair of caecal tubular
  prolongations from the air-bladder to the outer surfaces of the fibrous membranes which close a
  pair of vacuities in the outer bony walls of the periotic capsules, the inner surfaces being
  bathed by the perilymph surrounding the auditory organs. This method is characteristic of certain
  Serranidae, Berycidae, Sparidae, Gadidae, and Notopteridae,<a id="NtA_457"
  href="#Nt_457"><sup>[457]</sup></a> and probably in the Hyodontidae. In the second method, of
  which several Clupeidae (<i>e.g.</i> Herring, Pilchard, etc.) furnish examples, the periotic
  vacuities are open instead of closed, and the sac-like ends of the tubular extensions from the
  air-bladder are in actual contact with protruding outgrowths from the utriculus.<a id="NtA_458"
  href="#Nt_458"><sup>[458]</sup></a> The third method, by far the most elaborate, is by the
  intervention of a series of movably connected "Weberian" ossicles, of which the most posterior on
  each side (the tripus) is inserted into the dorsal wall of the air-bladder (Fig. 223), while the
  anterior one (scaphium) forms the outer wall of a median backward prolongation (sinus impar) of
  the perilymph-containing spaces surrounding the two auditory organs. This in turn encloses a
  similar median prolongation (sinus endolymphaticus) from the two sub-cerebrally united
  endolymphatic ducts (Fig. 223).<a id="NtA_459" href="#Nt_459"><sup>[459]</sup></a> This complex

  id="page390"><span class="smaller">{390}</span></span>The physiological <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of
  the connexion between the air-bladder and the auditory organ cannot yet be regarded as
  satisfactorily determined. It is possible, as Weber thought, that it may be an auxiliary to the
  function of hearing by transmitting to the ear sound-waves impinging on the surface of the body
  and affecting the gases in the air-bladder.<a id="NtA_462" href="#Nt_462"><sup>[462]</sup></a> On
  the other hand, it may be urged with perhaps greater probability that the connexion exists for the
  purpose of conveying to the ear stimuli due to the varying degrees of distension of the
  air-bladder, such as, it may be presumed, are naturally brought about by the variations of
  hydrostatic pressure which a Fish encounters in the course of its ascent or descent in the
  water.<a id="NtA_463" href="#Nt_463"><sup>[463]</sup></a> Whether regarded as an accessory to
  hearing, or as a means of regulating the distension of the air-bladder, the physiological value of
  the connexion must be considerable, and on this point it is at least significant that the Weberian
  mechanism is characteristic of the dominant families of freshwater Teleosts at the present day.<a

  </div>

  <p>The Cyclostomata are unique amongst Craniates in the apparently unpaired condition of the
  olfactory organ, and in its remarkable relation to the pituitary involution. In the embryo Lamprey
  the median and ventral olfactory pit is carried inwards with the pituitary invagination, so that
  the former appears as a dorsal outgrowth from the latter, and the two have a common external
  opening, the naso-pituitary aperture (Fig. 224). Later the extraordinary forward growth of the
  upper lip to form the roof of the buccal funnel has the effect of shifting the naso-pituitary
  involution and its aperture to a final position on the dorsal side of the head. It is due to this
  dorsal displacement that, as we shall see, the pituitary caecum reaches the ventral surface of the
  brain by perforating the basis cranii from above, instead of from below as in all other Craniates.
  The pituitary body is pinched off from the dorsal side of the naso-pituitary involution. In the
  adult Lamprey the olfactory organ appears as a round sac divided by a median septum into two
  lateral chambers (Fig. 225), the lining epithelium of which is raised into prominent ridges.
  Behind the sac the pituitary involution is prolonged backwards beneath the brain, and, after
  traversing the basi-cranial fontanelle, it widens out into a spacious cul-de-sac and terminates on
  the dorsal side of the pharynx, beneath the anterior end of the notochord. In <i>Myxine</i> the
  pituitary involution ends by opening into the pharynx.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The apparently monorhinal condition of the Cyclostomes is probably a secondary acquisition. At
  the earliest embryonic stage at which any trace of an olfactory organ is apparent, there is a
  median thickening of the epidermis, possibly a vestige of some older sensory organ comparable, it
  may be, to the so-called olfactory organ of Amphioxus; on each side of it there is a lateral
  thickening, the rudiments of the paired organs.<a id="NtA_465" href="#Nt_465"><sup>[465]</sup></a>
  The three thickenings, or "plakodes," then sink inwards to form an olfactory pit. The partial
  subdivision of the adult organ by a vertical septum, and the presence of two olfactory nerves,
  point to the same conclusion.<a id="NtA_466" href="#Nt_466"><sup>[466]</sup></a> All Fishes
  possess olfactory organs which are obviously paired. In Elasmobranchs and Dipnoi they retain their
  primitive ventral position. Many Sharks and Dog-Fishes possess an oro-nasal groove leading from
  each olfactory organ to the corresponding angle of the mouth. The Dipnoi proceed a stage farther,
  and, by the conversion of the grooves into short canals, the olfactory pits communicate with the
  mouth by true internal nostrils, as in the higher <span class="pagenum" id="page393"><span
  class="smaller">{393}</span></span>Vertebrates. In the adults of existing Teleostomi the orifice
  of each organ is usually divided into two by the growth of a fold of skin across it, and the two
  apertures rotate outwards and upwards on to the lateral or the upper surface of the snout. Of the
  two nostrils the posterior one probably corresponds to an external nostril, and the anterior one
  to the internal nostril. Occasionally each olfactory organ has only a single orifice. In the
  Crossopterygii and in some Teleostei the nostrils become tubular. The lining epithelium of the
  olfactory pits is usually produced into ridges, disposed longitudinally or transversely, or in the
  form of radii from a central point in the roof. Many Teleosts have each olfactory organ prolonged
  backwards into one or two sacs, the nasal sacs, which are either simple reservoirs, or glandular
  and mucus-secreting. In a species of Chinese Sole (<i>Cynoglossus semilaevis</i>) the two sacs,
  one from each olfactory organ, unite over the roof of the mouth in a common median sac, and in one
  unique specimen the latter communicated with the mouth by a large naso-pharyngeal aperture.<a
  id="NtA_467" href="#Nt_467"><sup>[467]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>The Eyes.</b>&mdash;In essential structure the eyes of Cyclostomes and Fishes resemble those
  of the higher Craniates. As a rule, in Fishes they are relatively larger, however, and the lens is
  globular and the cornea somewhat flatter. Ciliary processes and ciliary muscles are absent. As the
  eyes are nearly always lateral in position it is probable that monocular vision is the rule. In
  Teleosts and in <i>Amia</i> a "choroid gland," consisting of a mass of capillary blood-vessels,
  surrounds the optic nerve externally to the retina, and derives its blood from the efferent artery
  of the pseudobranch (Fig. 226). In most Teleostomi, but not in Cyclostomes, Elasmobranchs, and
  Dipnoi, there is a singular prolongation of the choroid coat, known as the "processus
  falciformis," which extends across the vitreous humour to the inner face of the lens, where it
  ends in an expansion, the "campanula Halleri" (Fig. 226). Accommodation to vision at different
  distances is not effected by alterations in the convexity of the lens, but by a change in its
  position with regard to the retina, apparently brought about by the contraction of a special
  retractor muscle.<a id="NtA_468" href="#Nt_468"><sup>[468]</sup></a> Some oceanic pelagic Teleosts
  are remarkable for their curious telescopic eyes in the shape of short protruding <span
  class="pagenum" id="page394"><span class="smaller">{394}</span></span>cylinders, each terminating
  in a strongly convex cornea (Fig. 227).<a id="NtA_469" href="#Nt_469"><sup>[469]</sup></a> The
  eyes are directed either upwards or forwards, and, as their long axes are parallel in either
  position, it is probable that these Fishes are capable of binocular vision. In the young of
  certain Teleosts occurring in the Antarctic and Indian Oceans the large eyes are situated at the
  extremities of extraordinary long stalks extending from the sides of the head.</p>

  <p>In the quasi-parasitic Cyclostome, <i>Myxine</i>, and in many Teleosts belonging to widely
  different families, which live at great depths in the sea or inhabit subterranean waters, the eyes
  suffer from disuse and degenerate in structure. The influence of a deep-sea habitat on the eyes of
  Fishes is somewhat varied. The eyes are often small. A few abyssal Fishes are totally blind, and
  no external trace of eyes can be seen (Fig. 430). In such Fishes compensation is often afforded by
  an extraordinary development of tactile organs in the form of long barbels, or of trailing
  filaments derived from the median or the paired fins (Fig. 371, B). Many deep-sea forms possess
  eyes of the normal size, or even exceptionally large eyes, probably because either they
  occasionally migrate towards the surface, or else they possess phosphorescent organs and are able
  to see by the aid of the light they themselves emit. A blind Siluroid (<i>Amiurus nigrilabris</i>)
  frequents the cave streams of Pennsylvania, and many members of the same family which live in
  muddy waters have very small or even minute eyes. One of the Gobies (<i>Typhlogobius</i>),<a
  id="NtA_470" href="#Nt_470"><sup>[470]</sup></a> which buries itself in the sand, or is found
  under stones in the holes of a burrowing Crab on the coast of California, is also <span
  class="pagenum" id="page395"><span class="smaller">{395}</span></span>blind. Amongst other blind
  Fishes <i>Amblyopsis</i> and <i>Typhlichthys</i> (Amblyopsidae)<a id="NtA_471"
  href="#Nt_471"><sup>[471]</sup></a> and <i>Lucifuga</i> (Zoarcidae) may be mentioned, the first
  two inhabiting the cave streams of North America, while the third has a similar habitat in Cuba.
  When the eyes degenerate they dwindle in size and recede from the surface. The lens and the iris
  wholly or partially disappear, and although it is generally recognisable the retina loses certain
  of its characteristic layers, or the latter are but imperfectly formed. In <i>Myxine</i> even the
  eye-muscles are absent.</p>

  <p>The eyelids of Fishes are little more than marginal folds of skin, capable of little if any
  movement, and leave the eyes largely uncovered. Some Sharks have a third eyelid or "membrana
  nictitans" at the anterior corner of the eye. Lachrymal glands are unknown.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>The Parietal Eye.</b>&mdash;It is only in the Cyclostomes that this structure can have any
  claim to be regarded as a visual organ. In the Lamprey (Fig. 228) the parietal eye is a slightly
  flattened vesicle lying directly over the pineal vesicle, and connected by a slender stalk or
  nerve with the right ganglion habenulae. The dorsal or more external half of the vesicle is
  bi-convex, and forms the "pellucida," while the inner half or retina is said to consist of
  supporting cells with interspersed deeply pigmented sense-cells and ganglion cells.<a id="NtA_472"
  href="#Nt_472"><sup>[472]</sup></a> The external skin over the parietal eye is partially
  transparent in the living animal.</p>

  <p>In many of the oldest known Fishes, such as the Ostracodermi, the Antiarchi, and the
  Crossopterygian Osteolepida, there are indications of the existence either of one or of two median
  sense-organs on the upper surface of the skull, in the shape of one or two foramina, or hollow
  protuberances, or pit-like grooves or <span class="pagenum" id="page396"><span
  class="smaller">{396}</span></span>depressions, but, as a rule, when one of them is present the
  other is absent. It is probable that both these structures were associated with sensory organs, of
  which one may have been a parietal eye and the other a pineal eye. Some Teleosts (<i>e.g.</i> many
  deep-sea Scopelidae) have a transparent, convex, cornea-like prominence on the upper surface of
  the head which may be related to one of these singular organs.<a id="NtA_473"

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="smaller">THE KIDNEYS AND THE
  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS&mdash;BREEDING</span></p>

  <p>The kidneys and the reproductive organs are so intimately connected that it is necessary to
  deal with them together. Both organs are specialised portions of the coelom and its epithelial
  lining. The <b>kidneys</b> are essentially a series of tubular and at first segmentally-disposed
  outgrowths from the coelom (urocoeles) which acquire a connexion with the exterior, while the
  gonads have their origin from local modifications of the coelomic epithelium. At a very early
  embryonic stage each lateral half of the coelom presents three well-marked divisions: (1) a series
  of dorsal portions ("myocoeles"), the cavities of the myotomes or muscle-segments; (2) a
  longitudinally continuous unsegmented portion extending round the alimentary canal, the "ventral
  coelom"; and (3) a series of intermediate tubular portions or "nephrotomes," each of which leads
  from a myocoele to the ventral coelom (Fig. 229, A). The essential components of the kidneys, the
  urocoeles or renal tubules, are derived from the nephrotomes. In its typical condition each kidney
  consists of three portions, which, in accordance with their embryological and evolutionary
  sequence, are termed the "pronephros," the "mesonephros," and the "metanephros." The pronephros,
  the larval or provisional kidney, is formed from a limited number of the nephrotomes immediately
  behind the head. From each nephrotome a hollow tubular outgrowth is formed, which grows towards
  the lateral surface of the body, and then unites with its fellows of the same side to form a main
  longitudinal duct&mdash;the "archinephric" or "pronephric duct" (Fig. 229, A, Fig. 230, A). This
  duct grows backwards until it opens into the cloaca.<a id="NtA_474"

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>At the same time the nephrotomes lose their connexion with the myocoeles, although they still
  retain their "nephrostomes" or apertures through which they communicate with the ventral coelom.
  When fully developed the pronephros consists of a few tubules, more or less convoluted, opening at
  their inner extremities into the coelom by means of their ciliated nephrostomes, and at their
  outer ends communicating with the exterior through the archinephric duct. In relation with the
  pronephros a branch from the dorsal aorta forms a tuft of capillary blood-vessels or "glomus,"
  opposite the nephrostomes, which projects into the ventral coelom on each side. Later, a second
  series of much more numerous tubules is formed behind the pronephros, which constitute the
  mesonephros. In forming mesonephric tubules the nephrotomes become disconnected from the myotomes
  and their myocoeles, and curving outwards they <span class="pagenum" id="page399"><span
  class="smaller">{399}</span></span>come to open into the archinephric duct, although they do not
  in any way contribute to its formation (Fig. 229, B). Segmentally-arranged twigs from the dorsal
  aorta end in tufts of capillaries or glomeruli, each of which projects into a small sac-like
  enlargement of a mesonephric tubule, pushing before it the wall of the sac. In this way a
  double-walled "Malpighian body," containing a "glomerulus," is formed in connexion with each
  tubule. Subsequently, the mesonephric tubules increase in number by budding. New nephrostomes and
  Malpighian bodies are developed on the secondary branches, and the original segmental arrangement
  of the tubules becomes obscured. With the growth of new tubules, and the formation of
  blood-vessels and of connective and lymphoid tissues between them, each mesonephros finally
  assumes the condition of a compact gland imbedded in the dorsal wall of the coelom, with its
  ventral surface invested by the peritoneum. A "metanephros," which in the higher Vertebrates
  replaces the mesonephros as the functional kidney, is perhaps not represented in Fishes.</p>

  <p>A more or less well-developed pronephros is present in the embryos or larvae of the Cyclostomes
  and of all Fishes, but as a rule it completely disappears at an early period and is replaced by
  the mesonephros. It is retained throughout life, however, in the Myxinoid Cyclostomes (Fig. 230,
  B), and has its persistent nephrostomes opening into the pericardial cavity.<a id="NtA_475"
  href="#Nt_475"><sup>[475]</sup></a> In a few Teleosts the pronephros is also persistent, as in
  <i>Fierasfer</i> and <i>Dactylopterus</i>, and in others the organ may not completely disappear
  until the approach of sexual maturity. But with these exceptions the mesonephros is the sole
  functional kidney in the adults of the Cyclostomes and of all Fishes. As regards the nature of the
  duct by which the excretion of the mesonephros is conveyed outwards, there are notable differences
  in different Craniates. The Cyclostomes and the Teleostomi retain that part of the archinephric
  duct into which the mesonephric tubules open, and which remains after the atrophy of the
  pronephros (Fig. 230, B, E, F). In Elasmobranchs, and probably also in the Dipnoi, a special
  mesonephric duct is developed in a way which will be described later (Fig. 230, C, D).</p>

  <p>In the males of Elasmobranchs some of the hinder mesonephric tubules unite to form a single
  main duct opening into the terminal part of the mesonephric duct, and these tubules and their
  separate duct are sometimes regarded as a metanephros and a metanephric duct. The mesonephric
  nephrostomes are persistent throughout life in a few Elasmobranchs (<i>e.g.</i> Notidanidae,
  Heterodontidae, Rhinidae, and some Scylliidae), and also in <i>Amia</i>:<a id="NtA_476"

  </div>

  <p>In many Fishes the hinder extremity of the coelom communicates directly with the exterior
  through "abdominal pores," of which there is usually a pair, rarely a single pore, situated close
  to the cloacal or the anal aperture.<a id="NtA_477" href="#Nt_477"><sup>[477]</sup></a>
  Elasmobranchs usually have a pair, often at the extremities of a pair of cloacal papillae (Fig.
  231), but they are absent in some families (<i>e.g.</i> Heterodontidae and Rhinidae); and in some
  Scylliidae (e.g. <i>Scyllium canicula</i>) they are very variable, being either present or absent
  on both sides, or an open pore is present on one side only. Pores are present and paired in the
  Crossopterygii, the Chondrostei, and the Holostei. Amongst the Dipnoi <i>Neoceratodus</i> has a
  pair of pores. <i>Protopterus</i> sometimes has two pores opening into the cloaca, but as a rule
  the two become confluent and have a single external aperture. In <i>Lepidosiren</i> pores are
  wanting. Abdominal pores are rarely present in Teleostei. They exist, however, in the Mormyridae
  (<i>Gymnarchus</i> and several species of <i>Mormyrus</i>), and also in the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page402"><span class="smaller">{402}</span></span>Salmonidae,<a id="NtA_478"
  href="#Nt_478"><sup>[478]</sup></a> where they are as singularly variable in different species and
  individuals as in the Elasmobranch Scylliidae. The use of abdominal pores is not certainly known,
  unless the coelom of those Fishes which possess them continues to retain some measure of its
  primitive excretory function, and the pores act as excretory ducts. That the nephrostomes are
  excretory organs has been shown by experiment, and it is worthy of note that there exists a
  reciprocal relation between these structures and abdominal pores, to the extent that while there
  are a few Fishes (<i>e.g.</i> certain Elasmobranchs and <i>Amia</i>) in which both coexist, there
  are many others in which the presence of nephrostomes is correlated with the absence of pores and
  <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

  <p>The male and female <b>gonads</b>, testes and ovaries, are derived from the coelomic epithelium
  near the inner or median aspect of the nephrotomes (Fig. 229, B). Here the epithelium remains
  columnar, and soon projects into the ventral coelom as a continuous longitudinal ridge. It is
  probable that at first the modified epithelium is segmented as a series of "gonotomes," but if so,
  the latter must soon coalesce into a continuous ridge. Some of the epithelial cells enlarge to
  form the primitive sex-cells. In the development of an ovary, portions of the epithelium sink
  inwards, carrying with them the primitive ova. Certain of the cells form the epithelial walls of a
  number of ovisacs, each of which encloses an ovum. As the ovisacs increase in number and size the
  germinal ridges project more and more into the coelom until, as ripe ovaries, they become
  suspended from its dorsal wall by a double peritoneal fold, the "mesovarium" (Fig. 156). The
  testes develop in a similar fashion except that the primitive sex-cells, which later give rise to
  spermatozoa, form the lining of a number of simple or ampulla-like tubules, the seminiferous
  tubules, and the suspensory fold is termed the "mesorchium."</p>

  <p>The Cyclostomes have gonads in the shape of unpaired organs extending nearly the whole length
  of the coelom, but in all Fishes the organs are primarily paired, although by fusion, or by the
  absorption of one gonad, the ovaries or the testes sometimes appear as if single. The ovaries may
  either be naked, as in Elasmobranchs, Dipnoi, Crossopterygii, and Chondrostei, and in <i>Amia</i>
  amongst the Holostei; or, as in <i>Lepidosteus</i> and most Teleosts, they become enclosed in
  coelomic sacs. The <span class="pagenum" id="page403"><span
  class="smaller">{403}</span></span>former, or "gymnoarian," condition is primitive; the latter, or
  "cystoarian," is secondary, and is brought about by the growth of two peritoneal folds round the
  ovary and the union of their margins. Into these coelomic sacs the egg-bearing or real ovarian
  tissue projects either in the form of processes or of transversely- or longitudinally-arranged
  plates or folds (Fig. 232, B). The testes are composed of seminal ampullae, as in Elasmobranchs,
  or of radially-arranged and sometimes plexiform tubules opening into the gonoduct, as in nearly
  all other Fishes (Fig. 232, A).</p>

  <p>In the Cyclostomes (e.g. <i>Petromyzon</i>) the eggs and spermatozoa are discharged from the
  gonads into the coelom, whence they reach the exterior through a pair of "genital pores" leading
  from the hinder end of the coelom into a urinogenital sinus formed by the united extremities of
  the two archinephric ducts.<a id="NtA_479" href="#Nt_479"><sup>[479]</sup></a> <i>Myxine</i> has,

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page404"><span class="smaller">{404}</span></span></div>

  <p>The nature and homologies of the genital ducts in the different groups of Fishes are amongst
  the most puzzling of the many problems which vex the soul of the Vertebrate morphologist, and
  although there is a fairly general agreement on some points, there are others of great importance
  of which it may be said <i>quot homines, tot sententiae</i>.</p>

  <p>Broadly speaking, there are two types of genital ducts in Fishes: (1) those which are obviously
  derived from some part of the kidney system; and (2) those which are special ducts and appear to
  have no connexion with kidney-ducts.</p>

  <p>The Elasmobranchs offer a typical example of gonoducts of the first kind. At an early embryonic
  period in both sexes each archinephric duct becomes longitudinally split into two ducts, of which
  one continues to receive the openings of the mesonephric tubules and remains as a mesonephric duct
  (Fig. 229, B).<a id="NtA_481" href="#Nt_481"><sup>[481]</sup></a> The other, which has no
  connexion with the mesonephros, opens anteriorly into the coelom by means of the united
  nephrostomes of the pronephros, and is known as the "M&uuml;llerian duct" (Fig. 230, C and D). In the
  adult male the M&uuml;llerian ducts are useless vestiges, but in the female they persist and act as
  oviducts, receiving the eggs set free from the ovarian ovisacs through their coelomic apertures,
  and thence conveying them to the cloaca. In the male, certain of the anterior mesonephric tubules
  become connected with the testicular ampullae by means of a network of slender tubules, the "vasa
  efferentia" or testicular network, and through the latter the spermatozoa pass from the testes to
  the mesonephric duct (Fig. 230, C). Consequently, the mesonephric duct conveys both spermatozoa
  and the kidney excretion to the cloaca.  It is obvious, therefore, that both the male and female
  gonoducts are derived from kidney-ducts.</p>

  <p>The Teleostei afford an equally typical illustration of the second type. Each female gonoduct
  (oviduct) is formed by a backward growth of the same two peritoneal folds which enclose the ovary;
  these are converted into a "peritoneal tube" or canal by the union of their margins. The male
  gonoducts are also formed in continuity with the testes, that is, as backward prolongations from
  the latter. Each duct, male or <span class="pagenum" id="page405"><span
  class="smaller">{405}</span></span>female, seems to be a duct <i>sui generis</i> and to have no
  connexion whatever with the kidney system (Fig. 230, E). In the Salmonidae, Anguillidae,
  Galaxiidae, Hyodontidae, Notopteridae, and Osteoglossidae, and also in <i>Misgurnus</i>, the
  oviducts lose their continuity with ovaries and degenerate to an extent which differs greatly in
  different families. Thus in some Salmonidae, as in the Smelt (<i>Osmerus eperlanus</i>),<a
  id="NtA_482" href="#Nt_482"><sup>[482]</sup></a> the oviducts end anteriorly in wide funnel-like
  coelomic apertures after the fashion of M&uuml;llerian ducts, and do not embrace the ovaries: hence the
  ovaries are naked and not cystoarian, and their ducts are not peritoneal tubes but "peritoneal
  funnels" (Fig. 230, F). In other Salmonidae and in the Anguillidae the oviducts appear to have so
  far degenerated that they are represented either by a pair of very short funnels or by a pair of
  genital pores, which, as in the Salmon, have a common external aperture behind the anus and in
  front of the single orifice of the united archinephric ducts (Fig. 233, A). In all such instances
  the eggs are set free from the ovaries into the coelom, from whence they escape through the
  peritoneal funnels or genital pores. In the Eels the male gonoducts also degenerate, and, losing
  all connexion with the testes, they become reduced to genital pores as in the female.</p>

  <p>The Holocephali and probably the Dipnoi conform to the Elasmobranch type in the nature of their
  male and female gonoducts. In the Crossopterygii<a id="NtA_483"
  href="#Nt_483"><sup>[483]</sup></a> each testis has its own proper duct, which has no connexion
  with the kidney system and apparently belongs to the Teleostean type, while the oviduct, which is
  almost certainly not a M&uuml;llerian duct, is probably a peritoneal funnel. On the other hand, the
  Chondrostei and the Holostei are in the interesting transitional condition of possessing male
  ducts of the Elasmobranch type and female ducts of the Teleostean type, the latter being either
  ducts directly continuous with the ovaries, as in <i>Lepidosteus</i>, or of the nature of
  peritoneal funnels, as in <i>Acipenser</i>, <i>Polyodon</i>, and <i>Amia</i> (Fig. 230, E and
  F).</p>

  <p>How far the distinction between the two types of gonoduct holds good in the case of the male is
  not quite clear, and it has recently been argued that the Dipnoi offer a connecting link between
  the two.<a id="NtA_484" href="#Nt_484"><sup>[484]</sup></a></p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In <i>Protopterus</i> each testis is divided into an anterior sperm-producing part and a
  posterior tubular portion which has lost the capacity of producing sex-cells. The testicular
  network is greatly reduced, and forms but a limited connexion between the tubular portion of the
  testes and the mesonephric duct (Fig. 233, B). If it be supposed that the testicular network
  became still further reduced so that the connexion between the testes and the kidney-duct took
  place directly through a single channel instead of through several, the result would be a gonoduct
  essentially similar to the male duct of an ordinary Teleost. Should this view prove to be correct,
  it will follow that the male gonoducts of <i>all</i> Fishes are differently-modified examples of
  the Elasmobranch type. But there will still remain the female gonoducts of Ganoids and Teleosts,
  which must be regarded as distinct from M&uuml;llerian ducts unless it can be shown that their
  different methods of development are not necessarily fatal to their homology with M&uuml;llerian ducts,
  or that both types of gonoduct can be derived from some intermediate type. Assuming that some
  Fishes do possess male or female ducts which have not been derived from the kidney system, but
  have been independently acquired, there is still the question, which of the two types is the more
  primitive, or, in other words, has the Elasmobranch type superseded the Teleostean, or <i>vice
  <span class="pagenum" id="page407"><span class="smaller">{407}</span></span>versa?</i> To this
  question no decisive answer can at present be given.</p>

  <p>The terminal relations of the kidney-ducts and the gonoducts, and the presence of accessory or
  of vestigial organs in connexion with them, will now be briefly dealt with. In the males of the
  Elasmobranchs the mesonephric ducts which, as already pointed out, act both as kidney-ducts and
  gonoducts, dilate posteriorly to form a pair of vesiculae seminales, and then unite to form a
  urinogenital sinus, opening into the cloaca at the extremity of a median papilla (Fig. 230, C).
  The sinus also receives ducts from the hinder part of the mesonephros, either separately, as in
  the female, or by a common duct on each side&mdash;the so-called metanephric duct&mdash;as in the
  male. Two tubular caecal outgrowths from the sinus form two sperm sacs. Only the anterior portions
  of the M&uuml;llerian ducts with their coelomic apertures are retained in the adult. In the female the
  mesonephric ducts are purely excretory, but otherwise they are similar, and the oviducts
  (M&uuml;llerian ducts) open into the cloaca separately or by a common orifice (Fig. 230, D). A
  glandular dilatation of each oviduct forms the oviducal or shell gland by which the horny
  egg-cases are secreted. In the males of the Holocephali the gonoducts open into a urinogenital
  sinus with an external orifice distinct from and behind the anus; but the female has separate
  apertures for the rectum, the conjoined oviducts, and the united mesonephric ducts. Both sexes
  have complete M&uuml;llerian ducts communicating with the coelom in front, and behind with the
  exterior. The Dipnoi of both sexes essentially resemble the Elasmobranchs in the general relations
  of their ducts, but the M&uuml;llerian ducts of the male exhibit marked differences in the three
  genera.<a id="NtA_485" href="#Nt_485"><sup>[485]</sup></a> In <i>Neoceratodus</i> the ducts are as
  complete as their functional representatives in the female. <i>Protopterus</i> retains anterior
  vestiges and the coelomic apertures, and also vestiges of the hinder portions which unite and end
  blindly in the urinogenital papilla, but the middle sections of the two ducts are suppressed (Fig.
  233, B). In the Teleostomi there is a general similarity in the terminal relations of the
  gonoducts and kidney-ducts. In the Ganoids the archinephric ducts unite and then expand into a
  urinary sinus or bladder, and the gonoducts of the female, or of both sexes in <i>Lepidosteus</i>,
  open either into the archinephric <span class="pagenum" id="page408"><span
  class="smaller">{408}</span></span>ducts or into the common sinus, and therefore both ducts
  communicate with the exterior by a urinogenital orifice behind the anus. Peritoneal funnels,
  similar to the functional oviducts of the female, are present in the males of the Chrondrostei and
  of <i>Amia</i>. In Teleosts the terminal connexions of the ducts tend to become less intimate. The
  archinephric ducts often dilate into a urinary bladder either before or after their union, and the
  common duct joins the united gonoducts to form a short urinogenital sinus which opens externally,
  or the confluent gonoducts have an independent genital orifice between the anus and the urinary
  aperture. Not rarely the genital or the urinogenital orifice is prolonged into a tubular papilla,
  which in the male acts as an intromittent organ, or, as in the females of the Cyprinoid <i>Rhodeus
  amarus</i>, the long oviducal tube serves the purpose of an ovipositor. The males and females of
  the Siluroid <i>Plotosus</i> have a remarkable vascular and glandular arborescent appendage just
  behind the urinogenital papilla, the use of which is unknown.<a id="NtA_486"

  <p>The <b>eggs</b> of different Fishes<a id="NtA_487" href="#Nt_487"><sup>[487]</sup></a> exhibit
  considerable diversity in size and shape as well as in the nature of their external coverings and
  their mode of deposition.<a id="NtA_488" href="#Nt_488"><sup>[488]</sup></a> The size of the eggs
  largely depends on the quantity of food-yolk stored up in their substance for the nutrition of the
  embryo: hence the eggs of Elasmobranchs, which resemble Fowls' eggs in the superabundance of their
  yolk, are by far the largest. Teleostomi have much smaller eggs. The largest Teleostean ova are
  those which are heavy and sink (demersal ova); the smallest, those which are buoyant and float
  (pelagic ova). Of the former, the eggs of <i>Gymnarchus</i> are about 10 mm. in diameter; those of
  the Salmon about 5 mm.; and those of some species of <i>Arius</i>, 5 to 10 mm. The eggs of the
  Wolf-Fish (<i>Anarrhichas lupus</i>) are about 6 mm. Smaller demersal ova are those of the
  Lump-sucker (<i>Cyclopterus</i>) and <i>Heterotis</i>, which are 2.6 and 2.5 mm. respectively.
  Pelagic <span class="pagenum" id="page409"><span class="smaller">{409}</span></span>eggs are very

  </div>

  <p>An egg-cell consists of living protoplasm and a nucleus, a variable quantity of non-living
  food-yolk, and of certain enveloping and protective egg-membranes. The ova of Fishes differ
  principally in the amount and disposition of the food-yolk, in the character of the egg-membranes,
  and in the presence or absence of special perforations in the egg-membranes for the entrance of
  spermatozoa into the eggs. In the small ova of some of the lower Chordata (<i>e.g.</i> Amphioxus),
  where the very small quantity of food-yolk is uniformly distributed, and its presence affects all
  parts of the egg alike, the process of segmentation which follows fertilisation results in the
  transformation of the entire egg into a mass of approximately equal-sized cells or blastomeres
  (Fig. 82). <span class="pagenum" id="page410"><span class="smaller">{410}</span></span>The eggs
  are therefore described as "alecithal," and the segmentation as being "holoblastic" and "equal."
  On the other hand, all Fishes possess "telolecithal" eggs, that is, ova in which the food-yolk is
  more or less abundant, and tends to accumulate at one pole of the egg ("vegetative pole"), while
  the opposite or "animal pole" consists of protoplasm, comparatively free from yolk granules and
  containing the nucleus (Fig. 234, A). The term telolecithal is, however, a somewhat comprehensive
  one, and covers important variations in the relations of the inert food-yolk and the living
  protoplasm in different Fishes, which greatly modify the process of segmentation. Thus there are
  some Fishes in which the amount of food-yolk at the vegetative pole is sufficient to retard
  segmentation in that part of the egg without actually preventing it, and consequently segmentation
  begins in the animal pole, and takes place more rapidly there than it does when it extends into
  the vegetative pole. Hence it follows that although the entire egg is segmented the blastomeres
  are of unequal size, the animal pole giving rise to a large number of small cells or micromeres,
  and the vegetative pole to a smaller number of much larger cells or macromeres. The segmentation
  of such an egg is said to be holoblastic but unequal (Fig. 234, B and C). This type of egg is
  characteristic of the Chondrostei, the Holostei, and the Dipnoi. In other Fishes, like the
  Elasmobranchs and the Teleostei, the food-yolk so greatly preponderates that it entirely prevents
  segmentation in the vegetative part of the egg, and segmentation is restricted to the small mass
  of protoplasm (germinal disc) at the animal pole, in which the nucleus is situated (Fig. 234, D).
  Eggs undergoing partial segmentation in this way are termed "meroblastic." No hard and fast line
  can be drawn between the two types, and in the Chondrostei and Holostei an interesting transition
  between the holoblastic and meroblastic ova may be observed. The egg-membranes are formed either
  by the egg itself or by the epithelium of the ovarian ovisacs, and, as will shortly be seen, the
  character of the outer egg-membrane greatly influences the mode of deposition of the eggs and
  their location afterwards. In Elasmobranchs the egg is enclosed in a stout horny egg-shell,
  secreted by the oviducal shell gland.<a id="NtA_489" href="#Nt_489"><sup>[489]</sup></a> In many
  Fishes, as in the Chondrostei, Holostei, and Teleostei, the egg-membranes <span class="pagenum"
  id="page411"><span class="smaller">{411}</span></span>are perforated at the animal pole of the egg
  by a small aperture or "micropyle," which is only large enough to admit of the entrance of a
  single spermatozoon at a time (Fig. 235). Generally, there is only a single micropyle, but,
  according to Salensky, the Sturgeon (<i>A. sturio</i>) has from 3 to 9, and the Sterlet (<i>A.
  ruthenus</i>) from 5 to 13.</p>

  <p>An important distinction may be made between the ova of different Teleostomi as regards their
  location after extrusion from the female. From this point of view two types of ova can be
  distinguished, <i>demersal</i> and <i>pelagic</i> ova. Demersal eggs are characterised by their
  larger size and greater weight, so that they always sink after extrusion; and by their opacity.
  They may either have an outer egg-membrane which is viscid and adhesive, so that the eggs readily
  adhere to one another or to foreign objects, or the membrane is smooth and non-adhesive. The
  Salmonidae, for example, produce non-adhesive demersal eggs, which remain separate after being
  deposited on the gravelly bed of a stream. Most freshwater and many marine shore Fishes have
  adhesive demersal eggs, which are deposited at the bottom of the water, generally adhering to one
  another in larger or smaller clumps, masses, or sheets, and attached to rocks, stones, or empty
  shells, like the eggs of many shore Fishes, or to aquatic plants after the fashion of the eggs of
  the Carp, Perch, and Pike, or even to branching zoophytes, as is the case with the eggs of the
  Sea-snail (<i>Liparis</i>). In some adhesive eggs the external egg-membrane forms threads for
  their attachment. The eggs of the Gar-Fish (<i>Belone</i>), and those of the Saury Pike
  (<i>Scombresox</i>) and of the Flying Fishes (<i>Exocoetus</i>), have viscid threads developed
  from opposite points on the surface, which are either attached to foreign objects or they become
  entangled with those of other eggs of the same species. The oval eggs of some of the Gobies have a
  bunch of fibres at one pole which serves to attach them. In the Smelt (<i>Osmerus eperlanus</i>) a
  portion of the outer egg-membrane breaks away from the rest and becomes turned back, inside out,
  but remains attached to the egg at one point. By means of this membrane the egg is attached to
  rocks or stones. Pelagic eggs are distinguished by their lightness and buoyancy, so that they
  always float near the surface of the water, and by their smaller size and remarkable transparency
  (Fig. 235). A conspicuous feature in many of them is the presence of a single <span
  class="pagenum" id="page412"><span class="smaller">{412}</span></span>large oil globule on the
  surface of the yolk, and not infrequently the yolk becomes partially or completely broken up into
  small masses. Pelagic eggs are always non-adhesive and free, and they invariably belong to marine
  Fishes. Amongst the British food Fishes which produce pelagic ova may be mentioned the Gadidae
  (<i>e.g.</i> Cod, Whiting, Hake, Ling), the Pleuronectidae (<i>e.g.</i> Turbot, Brill, Sole,
  Plaice), Scombridae (<i>e.g.</i> Mackerel), Triglidae (<i>e.g.</i> the Gurnards), Percidae
  (<i>e.g.</i> the Bass), and Clupeidae like the Pilchard and Sprat, but not the Herring, whose
  adhesive demersal eggs are deposited in clumps on shingly banks in the sea at varying distances
  from the shore.</p>

  <p>The eggs of Elasmobranchs are deposited singly or in pairs at considerable intervals, and the
  period of egg-laying is prolonged over a considerable part of the year. In most other Fishes, as
  in Teleosts, the period of spawning is limited to a few months, usually in the spring and summer
  in temperate latitudes; and in the case of a single Fish it may last only a few days or weeks, but
  the number of eggs produced is often enormous. Thus, in a Ling 61 inches long and weighing 54
  pounds the ovaries contained 28,361,000 eggs. A Turbot, 17 pounds in weight, had 9,161,000 eggs;
  and a Cod of 21&frac12; pounds 6,652,000. The least prolific of the British food Fishes is the Herring,
  in which the number of ovarian eggs varied from 21,000 to 47,000 in four specimens examined.<a
  id="NtA_490" href="#Nt_490"><sup>[490]</sup></a> The extraordinary fecundity of many Fishes seems
  to bear no relation to the relative abundance of the Fishes themselves, but rather it is to be
  associated with certain <span class="pagenum" id="page413"><span
  class="smaller">{413}</span></span>disadvantages attendant on the sexual relations of Fishes,
  involving a considerable waste of the sex-cells, while in many Fishes it no doubt helps to
  compensate for any subsequent mortality among the larvae, which may result from an uncertain and
  precarious food supply and from the attacks of enemies. Whenever internal fertilisation is the
  rule, or when, as in nest-building and marsupial Fishes, the propinquity of the sexes in the
  breeding season ensures the fertilisation of a larger proportion of the eggs and the protection of
  the young, the number of eggs produced is small.</p>

  <p>The male sex-cells or spermatozoa are essentially similar to those of other Vertebrates,
  although in different Fishes they may vary in such details as length, and the shape and size of
  the head, which may be rod-like and wavy, elliptical or globular.</p>

  <p>As a rule, in Fishes females are more numerous than males, and generally they are larger, but
  to both statements there are notable exceptions. The relations of the sexes in the breeding season
  are usually very promiscuous, especially in those Teleosts which discharge their sex-cells while
  swimming together in shoals. A female may, however, consort with several males (<i>polyandry</i>),
  or a male with several females (<i>polygamy</i>); or, as in some of the nest-building Fishes (e.g.
  <i>Gastrosteus</i>), there are not wanting examples of the pairing of one male with one female
  (<i>monogamy</i>).</p>

  <p>Fishes often migrate at the commencement of the breeding-season to localities most suitable for
  the deposition of the eggs. Many marine species seek banks or shallower water near the shore, and
  some, like the Salmon and the Sturgeon, are <i>anadromous</i>, and ascend rivers for long
  distances to deposit their spawn.</p>

  <p>In all Fishes except the Elasmobranchs and a few Teleosts the fertilisation of the eggs takes
  place in the water after their extrusion, the male depositing its seminal fluid over the eggs or
  in their neighbourhood. The waste of the sex-cells is often, no doubt, very considerable,
  especially when the eggs are adhesive and fixed, and the seminal fluid is liable to drift at the
  mercy of tides and currents. With pelagic ova the waste is perhaps not so great, inasmuch as the
  eggs as well as the spermatozoa would probably drift at the same rate and in the same direction.
  Liability to waste must also be greatly diminished in many Fishes by their habit of living in
  shoals, or of congregating <span class="pagenum" id="page414"><span
  class="smaller">{414}</span></span>together in the breeding season, in which they are sometimes
  aided by their power of emitting characteristic sounds, and in the case of nest-building Fishes by
  the still more intimate relations of the sexes. Even when the liability to waste is very great,
  compensation may be afforded by exceptional fecundity. The copulation of the sexes and the
  internal fertilisation of the eggs occur only in Elasmobranchs and some Teleosts. The copulatory
  organs of Elasmobranchs are the so-called "claspers" with which the males are provided. Some form
  of copulation is probably the rule in the viviparous Teleosts, where the eggs are fertilised in
  the oviducts, or even while they are still in the ovaries, and the young are born alive. As
  mentioned above, an intromittent organ is often formed by the prolongation of the genital or the
  urinogenital orifice into a papilla, or a longer or shorter tube.<a id="NtA_491"
  href="#Nt_491"><sup>[491]</sup></a> Some Cyprinodontidae<a id="NtA_492"
  href="#Nt_492"><sup>[492]</sup></a> (e.g. <i>Anableps</i>) have the anterior part of the anal fin
  modified in the male to form an intromittent organ along which the urinogenital canal runs (Fig.
  374). In the females the genital aperture is covered by a special scale, which is free on one side
  and not on the other. "The male organ in some individuals is turned to the right, in others to the
  left, and in some females the opening beneath the special scale is to the right, in others to the
  left. Copulation thus takes place sideways, a left-sided male pairing with a right-sided female,
  and <i>vice versa</i>."<a id="NtA_493" href="#Nt_493"><sup>[493]</sup></a> The anal fin also forms
  an intromittent organ in the "Half-beak" (<i>Hemirhamphus</i>). In a genus (<i>Girardinus</i>) of
  the same family the anal fin is modified to form an apparatus for holding the female during sexual
  congress.<a id="NtA_494" href="#Nt_494"><sup>[494]</sup></a> The singular method of fertilisation
  practised by the males and females of <i>Callichthys paleatus</i> is referred to elsewhere.<a

  <p>With the exception of the pelagic <i>Antennarius</i>, which builds its nest in the Sargasso
  weed in mid-ocean, nest-building and parental solicitude for the young are confined to freshwater
  Fishes and to marine forms with demersal ova. Pelagic ova must necessarily be beyond the scope of
  parental care. As a rule it is the male which acts as guardian nurse, the female troubling herself
  but little about the fate of her eggs or her offspring.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p> Perhaps the more primitive form of parental foresight is exhibited by those Fishes which, like
  the females of the Salmonidae, make a furrow in the gravelly bottom of a running stream for the
  reception of the eggs, and then cover them over with a layer of gravel, or like the Siluroid
  <i>Arius australis</i>, of the Burnett river in Queensland, which deposits its eggs in circular
  excavations in the sandy bed of the river and covers them with layers of large stones. But in
  neither case does it appear that either the male or the female takes any further interest in the
  eggs or in the young when hatched. Without actual nest-building, or even the preparation of a
  place for their reception, the eggs may be protected in various ways by the male. The common
  British Gunnel or Butter-Fish (<i>Pholis gunnellus</i>) rolls its eggs into a rounded mass by
  coiling its body round them, the male and female taking possession of them alternately. The little
  clumps of eggs are then deposited in holes made by the boring Mollusc, <i>Pholas</i>. Some British
  Blennies attach their eggs in a single layer to the sides of cavities in rocks, or between stones,
  where they are watched over by the male parent. The eggs of the Lump-Sucker (<i>Cyclopterus
  lumpus</i>) are attached in masses to rocks or to piles and guarded by the male, who aerates them
  by keeping up a flow of water over the spawn through the action of his pectoral fins. When
  hatched, the young fry cling to the body of their watchful parent by their suckers. A more decided
  approach to nest-building is exhibited by the Sand Goby (<i>Gobius minutus</i>). In this species
  the male scoops out the sand from beneath an empty shell, generally that of a Pecten, and the
  female deposits her adhesive eggs on the under surface of the shell.</p>

  <p> The male remains on guard, and by the movements of its pectoral fins promotes the aeration of
  this rude form of nest. References to some of the more striking examples of true nest-building in
  Fishes will be found in the systematic part of this volume, especially in those chapters treating
  of the Dipnoi and Amiidae, and such Teleosts as the Mormyridae, Osteoglossidae, Siluridae,
  Gastrosteidae, Centrarchidae, Osphromenidae, Labridae, and Antennariidae. Other illustrations of
  parental care are to be found in the development of marsupial pouches or grooves for the reception
  of the eggs in the males of the Syngnathidae (Fig. 387) and the females of the Solenostomidae, and
  the use of the oral cavity for a similar purpose in the males, rarely in the females, of some
  Siluridae, and the males or females, according to the species, of the Cichlidae. The singular
  method by which the female <i>Aspredo</i> safeguards both her eggs and her progeny is referred to
  on <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page596">596</a></span>. The Cyprinoid, <i>Rhodeus amarus</i>
  (the "Bitterling" of Central Europe), is unique in the means which it adopts to <span
  class="pagenum" id="page417"><span class="smaller">{417}</span></span>secure the same result.<a
  id="NtA_496" href="#Nt_496"><sup>[496]</sup></a> By means of its long ovipositor the female Fish
  deposits its eggs in the mantle cavity of a <i>Unio</i>, or of an Anodon. Here they are fertilised
  by spermatozoa carried in through the inhalent siphon of the Mollusc with the inspiratory water
  current, and they complete their development in the gill-cavities (Fig. 237).<a id="NtA_497"
  href="#Nt_497"><sup>[497]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The time which elapses between the fertilisation of the egg and the hatching out of the young
  Fish varies greatly in different Teleosts. The eggs of some Clupeidae hatch in a very short time,
  two to three days in the Anchovy, and three to four days in the Sprat. In most of the British
  marine food Fishes the period rarely exceeds twelve to fourteen days. The larger demersal eggs
  with much food-yolk are longer in hatching; in the Salmon the time ranging from thirty-five to one
  hundred and forty-eight days. A low temperature lengthens the time. The eggs of the Herring which
  hatched in eight to nine days at a temperature of 52&deg; to 58&deg; F. took forty-seven days in water at
  32&deg; F.</p>

  <p>The extent to which the development of the embryo proceeds while it is still enclosed in the
  egg-membranes, and consequently the condition of the embryo when hatched, depends largely but not
  exclusively on the quantity of food-yolk which is present in the egg and available for the
  nutrition of the embryo during its earlier stages. Embryos hatched from pelagic ova are very small
  and imperfectly developed. The mouth is usually not yet formed. The median fins, which later
  become isolated, are continuous, and the caudal fin is diphycercal, although it subsequently
  becomes homocercal after passing through a heterocercal stage. The blood is colourless, and even
  the gill-clefts may at first be lacking. In this condition the newly-hatched Fish is nourished at
  the expense of the residual food-yolk, which is enclosed in a yolk-sac projecting from the ventral
  surface of the body (Fig. 238). As the yolk is gradually used up the mouth is formed, and the
  young Fish feeds on the minute organisms of various kinds living in the sea, and by degrees the
  form, proportions, and structure of the more mature Fish are acquired. In the case of the larger
  demersal eggs the young are not only longer in hatching, but when hatched they are larger and more
  advanced in development. The young of many Fishes are <span class="pagenum" id="page418"><span
  class="smaller">{418}</span></span>provided with larval or provisional organs, and they may be so
  unlike the adult in other respects that their subsequent development assumes the form of a more or
  less striking metamorphosis. As examples of larval organs, mention may be made of the adhesive or
  cement organs of the larval Chondrostei and Holostei, and of the Dipnoi (e.g. <i>Protopterus</i>
  and <i>Lepidosiren</i>), and also of a Teleost, probably the Mormyrid (<i>Hyperopisus bebe</i>,
  Lac&eacute;p);<a id="NtA_498" href="#Nt_498"><sup>[498]</sup></a> the cutaneous gills of the
  Crossopterygii and some Dipnoi; the so-called external gills of such Teleosts as <i>Cobitis</i>,
  <i>Gymnarchus</i> (Fig. 239), and <i>Heterotis</i>, which are singularly like those of
  Elasmobranchs; and the defensive spines which are developed on the scales or scutes of the trunk,
  and the dermal bones of the skull, in the young of some Plectognathi. The most striking
  metamorphosis to be found in Fishes occurs in the Flat-Fishes and in the Eels, an account of which
  will be found in other parts of this volume (pp. 685, 602).</p>

  <p>The only examples of viviparous Fishes occur in certain families of Elasmobranchs,<a
  id="NtA_499" href="#Nt_499"><sup>[499]</sup></a> and in five families of Teleosts, viz. the
  Blenniidae, the Cyprinodontidae, the Scorpaenidae, the Comephoridae, and the Embiotocidae.<a
  id="NtA_500" href="#Nt_500"><sup>[500]</sup></a> In the Teleosts mentioned the eggs are fertilised
  while they are still either in the ovarian ovisacs or in the cavity of the ovary, and their
  development may take place in either position. In such Cyprinodonts as <i>Gambusia</i> and
  <i>Anableps</i> the embryos are developed in the ovisacs, but as a rule both fertilisation and
  development occur in the ovarian cavity. During a prolonged gestation the young are nourished
  partly by the <span class="pagenum" id="page419"><span
  class="smaller">{419}</span></span>food-yolk present in the eggs, and partly by a nutritive
  secretion derived from the ovarian walls or from the epithelial wall of the ovisacs as the case
  may be. In <i>Anableps</i> the secretion of the walls of the ovisacs is absorbed by papillae
  developed on the surface of the yolk-sac of the embryo along the course of its blood-vessels. The
  eggs of the Embiotocidae have little food-yolk, and the embryos are mainly nourished by the
  secretion of the ovarian walls, which is swallowed by the embryo and absorbed by villi on the
  inner surface of the intestine. The number of young produced varies considerably. In the
  Embiotocidae the ovarian cavity contains 40 to 50 young. The viviparous Scorpaenid, <i>Sebastes
  norvegicus</i> of Northern Europe, produces, it has been estimated, about 1000 young, while the
  Blenny (<i>Zoarces viviparus</i>), the only other European viviparous Teleost, produces from 20 to
  300 or more, according to the size of the female. In the Blenny the eggs are hatched in about
  twenty days, but the young are not born until about four months after fertilisation, when they are
  about an inch and a half long, and in every outward respect similar to the adult Fish.</p>

  <p>Besides the distinction between the sexes resulting from the different nature of their gonads
  and sex-cells, the males and females are often distinguished by secondary sexual characters <span
  class="pagenum" id="page420"><span class="smaller">{420}</span></span>("sexual dimorphism"<a
  id="NtA_501" href="#Nt_501"><sup>[501]</sup></a>). As mentioned above, females are usually larger
  as well as more numerous than the males, although in one or both respects the reverse may be the
  case. Secondary sexual characters are best marked in Teleosts, where they are generally related to
  the special r&ocirc;le which each sex takes in the deposition and fertilisation of the eggs, and the
  nurture and protection of the young, of which examples have already been given. To a more limited
  extent they may be associated with the struggle of the males for the females, and in at least a
  few Teleosts the exuberant coloration of the males in the breeding season suggests that instances
  of courtship and sexual selection are not altogether wanting.<a id="NtA_502"
  href="#Nt_502"><sup>[502]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="sp5">Although the vast majority of Fishes are dioecious, instances of functional
  hermaphroditism are not unknown in a few Teleosts.<a id="NtA_503"
  href="#Nt_503"><sup>[503]</sup></a> Species of the Percoid genus <i>Serranus</i> (e.g. <i>S.
  cabrilla</i>, <i>S. hepatus</i>, and <i>S. scriba</i>) are invariably hermaphrodite and
  self-fertilising. <i>Chrysophrys auratus</i> is an example of successive hermaphroditism, the male
  and female sex-cells ripening alternately. As an occasional variation hermaphroditism has been
  recorded in several other Teleosts, including amongst others such well-known Fishes as the Cod,
  the Mackerel, and the Herring. The relations of the gonads in hermaphrodites is subject to much
  variation. In the Cod, for example, the testes may be double, each being continuous with the
  hinder end of the ovary of its side, or there may be only a single testis confluent with the
  anterior or the posterior portion, or with some other part of the surface, of either the right or
  left ovary. In other Teleosts individuals occasionally present themselves with a testis and an
  ovary on opposite sides.</p>

  <p class="ac">CLASS I. CYCLOSTOMATA</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Cyclostomata, or, as they are sometimes called, the Marsipobranchii, from the
  pouch-like, or rather sac-like, shape of their branchial clefts, are divided into two orders, the
  first comprising the "Hag-Fishes" or "Borers," and the second the Lampreys.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order I. Myxinoides.</b></p>

  <p>The Hag-Fishes are probably the most primitive of all existing Craniates. The mouth is nearly
  terminal, and there is no buccal funnel. The naso-pituitary involution communicates behind with
  the oral cavity and functions as a channel for the in-streaming water-current to the gills. Four
  pairs of short tentacles, supported by a special tentacular skeleton, are present in relation with
  the mouth and the terminally-placed naso-pituitary orifice. The gill-sacs open directly into the
  pharynx. The branchial basket is but feebly developed, and at the most it is only represented by
  small isolated cartilages in relation with the external branchial apertures. The lingual apparatus
  is remarkably developed. Besides the lingual teeth there is only a single dorsal tooth in the roof
  of the mouth. The dorsal arcualia are restricted to the tail, or they extend for a short distance
  only into the trunk. A spiral valve is absent. There is a row of mucus-secreting sacs along each
  side of the body. The brain has no obvious cerebral hemispheres, nor a cerebellum. Only one
  semicircular canal is present in the auditory organ. The eyes are degenerate, and the usual
  eye-muscles with the cranial nerves <span class="pagenum" id="page422"><span
  class="smaller">{422}</span></span>supplying them have atrophied. The embryonic pronephros is
  retained in the adult. The eggs are large; segmentation is meroblastic; and development is direct,
  without a larval metamorphosis. Two families can be distinguished.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Myxinidae.</b>&mdash;Gill-sacs not exceeding six pairs, with a common external
  aperture on each side of the body.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The family includes a single genus, <i>Myxine</i>, of which the common Hag (<i>M.
  glutinosa</i>) from the North Atlantic is the best known species (Figs. 92, A, and 240). This
  Hag-Fish occurs off the coasts of Northern Europe, including the British Isles, as well as on the
  Atlantic sea-board of North America,<a id="NtA_504" href="#Nt_504"><sup>[504]</sup></a> southwards
  to Cape Cod. Other species are found off the coasts of Chili and Japan. <i>Myxine</i> is
  quasi-parasitic in its habits, boring its way into the bodies of large Fishes. By means of its
  rasping "tongue" it devours all the soft parts of its prey, leaving little more than a mere shell
  of skin and bones. The Fishes usually attacked are the Cod and other Gadoids, but the Sturgeon is
  not immune, and the presence of a Hag in the abdominal cavity of a Shark (<i>Lamna cornubica</i>)
  has been recorded. <i>Myxine</i> has the reputation of being very destructive to Fishes caught on
  lines, and it is said that whole "catches" have been destroyed by its depredations, so that North
  Sea fishermen have been forced to change their fishing-ground. To what extent the Hags attack
  Fishes which are living and free is somewhat uncertain, but the little evidence obtainable seems
  to point to the conclusion that, as a rule, they only prey on Fishes when the latter are hooked or
  netted, or injured or dead. When not seeking food the Hag lives <span class="pagenum"
  id="page423"><span class="smaller">{423}</span></span>in the mud of the sea-bottom at depths
  ranging to nearly 350 fathoms. They are able to swim very rapidly in an undulatory eel-like
  fashion. <i>M. glutinosa</i> may grow to a length of nearly two feet. The Hag has been described
  as a protandrous hermaphrodite, that is, it is first a male and then a female, the gonad of the
  young first producing spermatozoa, and at a later period becoming an ovary and giving rise to
  eggs. This view has hitherto met with general acceptance, but it has recently been urged with some
  force that the presence of the two kinds of sex-cells in a young animal is no proof of functional
  hermaphroditism, since it is not uncommon "to find immature eggs in the testis of many Vertebrates
  (Teleosts, <i>Petromyzon</i>, Amphibia), where the assumption of hermaphroditism, to say nothing

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Bdellostomatidae.</b>&mdash;Gill-sacs 6-14 pairs, all with separate external
  orifices. <i>Bdellostoma</i> (Fig. 92, B) is found on the Pacific sea-board of both North and
  South America, at the Cape of Good Hope, and on the coasts of New Zealand. The numerical variation
  of the gill-sacs in different species, and in different individuals of the same species, and even
  on opposite sides of the same individual, is very remarkable. Out of 354 examples of the
  Californian species (<i>B. stouti</i>) examined by Dr. Ayres,<a id="NtA_506"
  href="#Nt_506"><sup>[506]</sup></a> 101 had 11 gill-sacs on each side; 26 had 11 on one side and
  12 on the other; 208 had 12 on each side; 11 had 12 on one side and 13 on the other; and 8 had 13
  on each side. Occasional specimens may have 14 gill-sacs on each side. The variations are
  apparently quite independent of size, age, or sex; and when the gill-sacs are asymmetrically
  developed, the additional sac may be either on the right side or on the left. In the Chilian
  species there are 10 gill-sacs on each side, but in the species from the Cape of Good Hope the
  number is reduced to 6 or 7.&nbsp;<i>Bdellostoma</i> closely resembles <i>Myxine</i> in its habits
  and mode of feeding. The Californian species attaches itself to the gills or to the isthmus of
  large Fishes, and then rapidly bores its way into the body, devouring the viscera and muscles but
  leaving the skin intact. It usually attacks large <span class="pagenum" id="page424"><span
  class="smaller">{424}</span></span>Flounders and species of <i>Sebastodes</i>, and it is
  especially destructive to Fishes taken in gill-nets. At Monterey every net in the summer contains
  the empty shells of eviscerated Fishes, and when these are taken out of the water the Hag
  scrambles out with great alacrity. Large fishes of even 30 pounds weight are often captured
  without either flesh or viscera, and it cannot be supposed that they entered the net in this
  condition.<a id="NtA_507" href="#Nt_507"><sup>[507]</sup></a> The species lives on the sea-bottom
  most abundantly at a depth of 10-20 fathoms, but becomes rarer as the water deepens or becomes

  <p>The eggs of the Californian <i>Bdellostoma</i> are large, varying in size from 14.3-29 mm. in
  length, and from 6.8-10.5 mm. in width, and each egg is enclosed in a horny egg-case secreted by
  the epithelium of its ovarian ovisac<a id="NtA_508" href="#Nt_508"><sup>[508]</sup></a> (Fig.
  241). At each pole of the egg-case there is a tuft of numerous horny filaments which end in 2- 3-
  or 4-hooked, anchor-like extremities. In the centre of the tuft of filaments at the animal pole of
  the egg the egg-case is perforated by a micropyle, and a little below this <span class="pagenum"
  id="page425"><span class="smaller">{425}</span></span>point the case is encircled by an opercular
  groove, which enables the polar portion to be thrown off like a cap at the time of hatching, so as
  to allow the young <i>Bdellostoma</i> to make its escape. The large size of the egg, which almost
  completely fills the cavity of the egg-case, is due to the fact that it consists mainly of food
  yolk, the germinal protoplasm containing the nucleus forming only a small hillock near the inner
  extremity of the micropyle. <i>Bdellostoma</i> spawns during the greater part of the year, but
  chiefly in the early summer, and probably about 20 eggs are deposited at one time, generally on a
  shelly or rocky bottom. After deposition the eggs become connected together in long chains or
  clusters by the interlocking of their polar hooks. Fertilisation takes place after extrusion, and
  the segmentation is meroblastic and discoidal, much as in Teleosts. The embryo completes its
  development within the egg, and when hatched it is a miniature of the adult.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order II. Petromyzontes.</b></p>

  <p>In the Lampreys there is a large suctorial buccal funnel leading behind and above into the
  mouth, which is supported by special cartilages, and furnished with a marginal fringe of small
  cirri. Numerous horny teeth are present on the inner surface of the funnel as well as on the
  tongue. The naso-pituitary involution forms a caecum and does not communicate with the mouth. The
  gill-sacs, seven in number, open externally by separate orifices, but internally they open into a
  median branchial canal, situated below the oesophagus and opening into the mouth in front. There
  is a well-developed branchial basket. Dorsal arcualia are present throughout the precaudal as well
  as in the caudal region. A rudimentary spiral valve is present. The brain consists of parts
  usually present in other Craniates, including cerebral hemispheres and a cerebellum. The auditory
  organ <span class="pagenum" id="page426"><span class="smaller">{426}</span></span>has two
  semicircular canals, and the eyes are not degenerate. The pronephros is suppressed in the adult.
  The eggs are small; the segmentation is holoblastic; and there is a larval metamorphosis. There is
  but one family.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Petromyzontidae.</b>&mdash;The family has a nearly world-wide distribution. Most
  Lampreys are marine, although to a greater extent in some species than in others, but all of them
  seem to ascend rivers for spawning. The genus <i>Petromyzon</i> is characteristic of the northern
  hemisphere, where it is represented by various species on the coasts and in the rivers of Europe,
  West Africa, Japan, and North America. Three species, widely distributed in Europe, occur in the
  British Isles, viz.:&mdash;the Sea-Lamprey (<i>Petromyzon marinus</i>), which may reach or even
  exceed three feet in length, and is also found on the west coast of Africa and on the Atlantic
  coast of North America; the "Lampern" or fresh-water Lamprey (<i>P. fluviatilis</i>), about 18
  inches long; and the Sand-Pride, Sand-Piper, or lesser freshwater Lamprey (<i>P. planeri</i>),
  usually less than a foot in length. <i>Ichthyomyzon</i>, <i>Bathymyzon</i>, <i>Entersphenus</i>,
  and <i>Lampetra</i> are also northern forms, collectively distributed along the Atlantic and
  Pacific coasts and in the rivers and great lakes of North America.<a id="NtA_509"
  href="#Nt_509"><sup>[509]</sup></a> Other Lampreys occur only in the southern hemisphere.
  <i>Geotria</i> is common in the rivers of Chili, Australia, and New Zealand; and another genus,
  <i>Mordacia</i>, has a parallel distribution, being found on the coasts of Chili and Tasmania. A
  new genus and species from Chili has been recently described under the name of <i>Macrophthalmia
  chilensis</i>.<a id="NtA_510" href="#Nt_510"><sup>[510]</sup></a> This Lamprey, which is only 107
  mm. in length, has remarkably large eyes (2.5 mm. in diameter), vertically compressed gill-clefts,
  and a simple dentition resembling that of <i>Myxine</i>. All Lampreys are carnivorous. They feed
  by attaching themselves to the bodies of Fishes by their suctoral buccal funnels, and then rasping
  off the flesh with their lingual teeth. While thus engaged they are carried about by their
  victims. Salmon have been captured in the Rhone with the marine Lamprey attached to them. The
  Lamprey usually keeps near the bottom, either swimming with a graceful serpentine movement, or
  attached to stones by the buccal funnel.</p>

  <p>In the spring the Sea-Lamprey ascends the rivers to spawn, and, after depositing its eggs in
  furrows which it excavates in the river-bottom, it returns to the sea. The river-Lampreys spawn in
  the smaller streams and brooks. The North American Brook-Lamprey, <i>Petromyzon</i>
  (<i>Lampetra</i>) <i>wilderi</i>, which is found in the neighbourhood of New York, deposits its
  eggs on the gravelly bottom of a brook, in a small gravel-filled hole lying between a number of
  large rounded stones<a id="NtA_511" href="#Nt_511"><sup>[511]</sup></a> (Fig. 243). In the
  vicinity of the "nest" some ten to twelve Lampreys congregate, the males, however, being much more

  <p>Much energy is spent by both sexes in moving stones by lifting them with the buccal funnel, but
  it is not always clear that this is done to circumscribe the nest, or to remove impeding
  obstacles. Eventually, a male attaches himself to the back of the head of a female, who at the
  same time is holding fast to a stone. The male then rotates its body so that the urino-genital
  papilla is brought near the genital orifice of the female, and the simultaneous extrusion of eggs
  and spermatozoa at once follows. Owing to the small amount of food-yolk which they contain the
  eggs of the Lamprey (e.g. <i>P. planeri</i>) are small, measuring about 1.1-1.2 mm. in length, and
  from 0.9-1.0 mm. in width. There is a micropyle at the animal pole of the egg, but the
  characteristic horny egg-case and the polar hooks of the Myxinoids are both wanting. The embryo
  hatches out as a larva known as the "Ammocoetes." At this stage of its development the larva lacks
  several of the most striking features which characterise the adult, and it is highly probable that
  the Ammocoetes represents a stage in the evolution of Vertebrates in some respects intermediate
  between <i>Amphioxus</i> and a very primitive Craniate. The mouth of Ammocoetes is bounded
  laterally and in front by a curious hood-like upper lip, and behind by a short transverse lower
  lip (Fig. 244). The eyes are deeply seated and rudimentary, and as visual organs they are useless,
  but the parietal eye is well developed. As in the adult, there are seven pairs of gill-sacs, but
  they open internally into a pharynx, directly continuous behind with the rest of the alimentary
  canal, and there is no dorsal oesophagus. Like the skull, the branchial basket is still very
  rudimentary. The dorsal and caudal fins are <span class="pagenum" id="page429"><span
  class="smaller">{429}</span></span>continuous. A gall-bladder is present, and also a bile duct
  opening into the gut. In its mode of life, and especially in the manner in which it obtains its
  food, Ammocoetes presents a most remarkable resemblance to <i>Amphioxus</i> and the Ascidians. In
  the median line of the pharyngeal floor there is an open groove, the hypopharyngeal groove or
  endostyle, and a tract of ciliated cells along the dorsal wall represents a hyperpharyngeal
  groove: connecting the two in front there is a peripharyngeal ciliated groove.<a id="NtA_512"
  href="#Nt_512"><sup>[512]</sup></a> The Ammocoetes feeds on small food particles carried through
  the mouth into the pharynx by currents of water produced by ciliary action. The food becomes
  entangled in strings of mucus probably secreted by the cells lining the endostylar groove. The
  mucus is then swept upwards in the pharyngeal groove, and finally wafted backwards to the stomach
  and intestine by the cilia of the hyperpharyngeal band. The skin exhibits the remarkable
  peculiarity of containing a peptic ferment capable of digesting proteids in a .2 per cent solution
  of hydrochloric acid. As the larva lives buried in the mud, the epidermic secretion probably helps
  to keep the skin free from bacteria, microscopic spores, and fungoid, or other parasitic
  growths.<a id="NtA_513" href="#Nt_513"><sup>[513]</sup></a> The young Lamprey lives as an
  Ammocoetes from 3-4 years, and then in the course of a few weeks in the winter it undergoes a
  metamorphosis, losing its larval characters and acquiring the structure and habits of the adult.
  During this period the buccal funnel is completed and teeth are developed. The eyes approach the
  surface and become functional. The continuity of the median fins becomes interrupted. The
  endostylar groove becomes transformed into a thyroid gland, the gall-bladder disappears, and the
  bile duct becomes obliterated and changed into a mass of small follicles. The skull and branchial
  basket complete their development. At the same time the pharynx loses its connection with the rest
  of the alimentary canal and remains as the branchial canal. The so-called oesophagus of the adult
  is apparently a new formation which grows forwards and acquires a connection with the mouth. It is
  probable that it represents a hyperpharyngeal groove constricted off from the dorsal wall of the
  pharynx.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Both the marine Lamprey and the "Lampern" are captured <span class="pagenum"

  Formerly the Lampern was taken in enormous numbers in several British and Irish rivers, especially
  in the Severn from February to May, and in the Thames during May and June, but for various reasons
  the supply has much diminished in recent years. The Lampern makes excellent bait for Cod and
  Turbot, and for this purpose large numbers used to be taken in the Trent and Thames for despatch
  to Grimsby and other fishing ports.<a id="NtA_514" href="#Nt_514"><sup>[514]</sup></a></p>

  </div>

  <p class="sp3 ac">CLASS II. PISCES.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Class I. Elasmobranchii.</b></p>

  <p>In both the ancient and the modern Sharks, Dog-Fishes, and Rays, the exoskeleton takes the form
  of a more or less uniform investment of dermal denticles or "shagreen." The endoskeleton is wholly
  cartilaginous or partially calcified, and there are neither cartilage- nor membrane-bones. The
  vertebral column is acentrous or chordacentrous, generally with alternating basi- and inter-dorsal
  elements, and terminating in a heterocercal tail. The skull is usually hyostylic, very rarely
  amphistylic or autostylic, and the lateral halves of the primary upper jaw (palato-quadrate
  cartilages) usually meet in a highly characteristic median symphysis beneath the base of the
  skull. Branchial arches and clefts are five to seven in number, and the clefts are separated by
  complete interbranchial septa, which, as a rule, are continuous externally with the skin. An
  operculum is developed only in the Holocephali. A pelvic girdle is present. With rare exceptions
  the pectoral fin is uniserial. The pelvic fin is invariably uniserial. The exoskeletal supports of
  all the fins consist of ceratotrichia, and, when present, the fin-spines are invested by enamel.
  Claspers are generally present in the males.</p>

  <p>In the surviving members of the group the nostrils retain their primitive ventral position.
  There is a conus arteriosus with several rows of valves. A spiracle, often furnished with a
  spiracular pseudobranch, is generally present, and, as a rule, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page432"><span class="smaller">{432}</span></span>there is a hyoidean hemibranch supplied with
  venous blood from the ventral aorta. The gill-filaments are attached throughout their length to
  the interbranchial septa. There is an optic chiasma. An air-bladder is not developed. The
  intestine has a spiral valve, and there is a cloaca. The gonoducts in both sexes are derived from
  the kidney system. The ova are large, few in number, and enclosed in horny egg-cases, and they are
  fertilised before extrusion. The segmentation is meroblastic, and the embryo is furnished with
  long external gills.</p>

  <p>The Elasmobranchs are for the most part active predaceous Fishes, living at different depths in
  the sea, from the surface to nearly a thousand fathoms, and ranging from mid-ocean to the
  shallower waters round the coasts in almost every part of the world. Although typically marine,
  they sometimes ascend rivers beyond the reach of tides, and a few are permanent inhabitants of
  fresh water. They are most abundant in tropical and subtropical areas, where they also attain
  their greatest size, and are numerous in temperate regions, but there are some species which are
  typically Arctic. None of them are small, and some of the Sharks are the largest of living Fishes.
  All are carnivorous, but so diversified is their food that in different species it may range from
  other Fishes of no mean size to Molluscs, Crustaceans and other Invertebrates, or even to
  plankton. In their breeding habits the Sharks and Dog-Fishes present many interesting features.
  Unlike the generality of Fishes, the eggs are fertilised internally as a sequel to the copulation
  of the sexes. For this purpose the males are furnished with special intromittent organs, the
  myxopterygia or so-called claspers, which are developed as modifications of the hinder portions of
  the pelvic fins.<a id="NtA_515" href="#Nt_515"><sup>[515]</sup></a> Each clasper is supported by
  an internal skeleton, consisting of several cartilages derived from the radialia of the fins, and
  is traversed along its inner aspect by a groove. When sexual congress takes place the claspers are
  thrust through the cloaca of the female into the oviducal orifices, and in some instances it is
  probable that they are retained in this position by hook-like denticles developed at their free
  extremities. The seminal fluid then flows along these conduits into the oviducts, in the upper
  portions of which it meets and impregnates the eggs. After fertilisation the egg is enclosed in a
  dark brown horny egg-case, secreted by the oviducal gland.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>As a rule each egg-case has but a single egg, but in <i>Rhinobatus</i> and <i>Trygonorhina</i>
  (Batoidei), both of which are viviparous, each case contains three to four eggs. Generally the
  egg-cases are somewhat quadrangular in shape, with the four angles, two at each end, prolonged
  either into short horns, or into long tapering tendrils (Fig. 246). The oval egg-cases of the
  Heterodontidae are remarkable not only for their size, but also for the presence of a broad spiral
  lamina winding round the exterior of the case from one pole to the other (Fig. 245). The majority
  of the Sharks, Dog-Fishes, and Rays are viviparous, that is, the young are born alive; the rest,
  like the Scylliidae (<i>e.g.</i> the common British Dog-Fishes, <i>Scyllium canicula</i> and <i>S.
  catulus</i>), the Heterodontidae, and the Raiidae are oviparous, that is, the young are hatched
  out after the extrusion of the eggs. In the oviparous species the eggs are extruded either singly
  or in pairs, and generally deposited on the sea-bottom. When, however, the egg-cases are provided
  with tendrils, as, for example, in the two British Dog-Fishes just mentioned, these organs act as
  anchoring filaments. When extruding an egg, the female swims round and round some piece of upright
  seaweed, and the curling tendrils become entwined round it in such a way that the egg becomes
  securely attached thereto (Fig. 246).<a id="NtA_516" href="#Nt_516"><sup>[516]</sup></a> The
  embryos are long in developing, and in <i>Scyllium</i> it may be several months after
  fertilisation (200 to 275 days) before they are hatched, the young Fish finally escaping through a
  rupture in the egg-case.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the oviparous species the nutritive food-yolk stored up, first in the egg and subsequently
  in the yolk-sac (Fig. 248), suffices for the nourishment of the embryo until the period of
  hatching, but in viviparous forms, whose embryonic development is completed within special uterine
  dilatations of the oviducts, additional means of nutrition are provided for the young. Such
  Elasmobranchs as <i>Spinax</i>, <i>Acanthias</i>, <i>Centrina</i>, <i>Scymnus</i>, <i>Trygon</i>,
  <i>Torpedo</i>, and <i>Myliobatis</i> have long filaments (villi or trophonemata) developed from
  the inner surface of the uterus, which secrete a nutritive fluid, and this fluid is either
  absorbed by the blood-vessels of the embryonic yolk-sac, or it is taken up by the embryo in some
  more direct manner. In some of the Trygonidae and Myliobatidae of the Indian Ocean it seems
  probable that the secretion is taken into the alimentary canal of the embryo either through the
  mouth or through the open spiracles.<a id="NtA_517" href="#Nt_517"><sup>[517]</sup></a> One
  species, <i>Pteroplatea micrura</i>, has its long and highly vascular and glandular trophonemata
  gathered into two bundles, which are thrust through the huge spiracles into the pharynx of the
  embryos, of which there may be from one to three, and the nutritive secretion is apparently
  digested in the alimentary canal of the embryo and absorbed by the foetal blood-vessels (Fig.
  247). A few Sharks, like most species of <i>Mustelus</i>, develop a placenta when the food-yolk in
  the yolk-sac of the embryo is nearly used up. Folds or projections from the highly vascular wall
  of the yolk-sac interlock with similar vascular folds of the lining membrane of the uterus, and a
  diffusion of nutrient material takes place from the maternal blood in the uterine blood-vessels to
  the foetal blood in the <span class="pagenum" id="page435"><span
  class="smaller">{435}</span></span>vessels of the yolk-sac.<a id="NtA_518"
  href="#Nt_518"><sup>[518]</sup></a> Each embryo has its own placenta, and in <i>Mustelus
  antarcticus</i> the uterine portion of the oviduct is divided by septa into several chambers, each
  containing a single embryo.<a id="NtA_519" href="#Nt_519"><sup>[519]</sup></a> It is worthy of
  note that in the viviparous species a distinct but very thin, delicate egg-case is formed,
  occasionally even with the rudiments of tendrils, which may either be retained or thrown off in
  the uterus. The Greenland Shark (<i>Laemargus borealis</i>) is unique amongst Elasmobranchs. Its
  eggs are small and unprotected by egg-cases, and their fertilisation is said to be effected in the
  water after deposition, as in the generality of Fishes.</p>

  <p>Fossil remains of Elasmobranchs in the shape of fin-spines (ichthyodorulites) and dermal
  denticles, associated with various Ostracodermi (Coelolepidae, Pteraspidae, and Cephalaspidae),
  are amongst the earliest undoubted indications of Vertebrate life. They first appear in the Upper
  Ludlow Bone Bed and in Silurian rocks in other parts of Europe, and in North America; and in
  greater or less abundance the group is represented in almost every subsequent geological period.
  It cannot be said that the group shows signs of decadence, for Elasmobranchs still survive in
  apparently undiminished numbers and variety in the marine fauna of the present day.</p>

  <p>The Elasmobranchs are certainly a very primitive race of Fishes. Their earliest representatives
  of whose structure we have any precise knowledge (e.g. <i>Cladoselache</i> and
  <i>Pleuracanthus</i>) are in many respects the most archaic of known gnathostomatous <span
  class="pagenum" id="page436"><span class="smaller">{436}</span></span>Craniates, and from such
  types as these, amongst others, we may reasonably look for the ancestors of all or most of the
  remaining groups of Fishes. It has been well said of <i>Pleuracanthus</i> that "it is a form of
  Fish which might with little modification become either a Selachian, Dipnoan, or
  Crossopterygian,"<a id="NtA_520" href="#Nt_520"><sup>[520]</sup></a> while the condition of the
  primary upper jaw in the Chondrostean <i>Polyodon</i> suggests that even the more primitive
  Actinopterygii had an Elasmobranch origin. The important researches of Dr. Traquair render it also
  highly probable that the ancient Ostracodermi may claim kinship through their Coelolepid ancestors
  with some primitive type of Elasmobranch; and within the limits of the group there is ample
  evidence that differentiation has taken place on many divergent lines, of which we have notable
  examples in such specialised offshoots as the Acanthodei and the Holocephali, to say nothing of
  several highly specialised families which became extinct at successive periods in the history of
  the group.</p>

  <p>The only certain representative of this group is the Palaeozoic form <i>Cladoselache</i>,
  probably the most primitive Elasmobranch at present known (Fig. 249). Elongated and somewhat
  cylindrical in shape, <i>Cladoselache</i><a id="NtA_521" href="#Nt_521"><sup>[521]</sup></a> has a
  terminal mouth, five or possibly seven pairs of branchial clefts, and a pair of olfactory organs,
  lateral in position near the extremity of the snout. Wide-based, triangular pectoral and pelvic
  fins, a low anterior and a posterior dorsal fin, devoid of spines, and a heterocercal caudal fin
  with homocercal tendencies, are present, but no anal fin has yet been detected.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The exoskeleton consists of minute lozenge-shaped denticles, which invest the body and extend
  on to the surfaces of the fins, and there is also a circumorbital ring of several concentric rows
  of small square plates. A lateral line, in the form of a groove between two rows of denticles,
  extends along each side of the body. The notochord is persistent. Calcified neural and haemal
  arches (basidorsals and basiventrals) have been observed in the caudal region, where they
  correspond numerically with the remains of the myotomes, but interdorsal or intercalary arcualia
  seem to be absent. The upper and lower jaws, similar in size and shape, are apparently supported
  by a hyomandibular cartilage; hence the skull is hyostylic. The endoskeletal supports of the
  pectoral, and especially those of the pelvic fins, exhibit a more primitive disposition than in
  any other Fishes. They extend nearly to the distal margins of the fins, where they seem to
  interdigitate with the proximal ends of feebly-developed ceratotrichia (Fig. 145). The extension
  of the fins in the horizontal plane, the gradual shading off of their broad bases into the sides
  of the body, and the resemblance between their radialia and those supporting median fins, are very
  suggestive of the origin of the paired fins from continuous lateral fin-folds. Claspers are
  absent. The dentition is well developed, and several rows of teeth seem to be functional at the
  same time. <span class="pagenum" id="page438"><span class="smaller">{438}</span></span>Each tooth
  consists of a broad base, supporting a long pointed central cusp and a variable number of
  similarly shaped but much shorter lateral cusps. The teeth in the various transverse rows from
  without inwards are closely wedged together by the interlocking or overlapping of their bases.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Fam. 1. Cladoselachidae.</b>&mdash;Several species of <i>Cladoselache</i>,
  varying from 2 to 5 feet in length, have been found in the Cleveland Shale (Upper Devonian) of
  Ohio. Isolated teeth similar to those of <i>Cladoselache</i> occur in the Lower Carboniferous of
  Europe, India, and North America, and have been referred to various species of the genus
  <i>Cladodus</i>, but with one exception nothing more is known of the structure of these Fishes,
  and consequently their relationship to <i>Cladoselache</i> is doubtful. <i>C. neilsoni</i>,<a
  id="NtA_522" href="#Nt_522"><sup>[522]</sup></a> from the Lower Carboniferous (Calciferous
  Sandstones) of Kilbride in Scotland, has a very different type of pectoral fin, which appears to
  be distinctly uniserial, but intermediate in structure between the biserial fin of
  <i>Pleuracanthus</i> and that of the modern sharks. There are several other genera from the
  Devonian and Lower Carboniferous whose claims to inclusion in this group rest on no better
  foundation.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order II. Ichthyotomi.</b></p>

  <p>While more specialised than the Pleuropterygii the Fishes included in this group represent an
  extremely generalised type of Elasmobranch, which, as already indicated, may easily have been the
  ancestor of more than one group of Fishes. In the typical genus <i>Pleuracanthus</i><a
  id="NtA_523" href="#Nt_523"><sup>[523]</sup></a> (Fig. 250)<a id="NtA_524"
  href="#Nt_524"><sup>[524]</sup></a> the body is elongate, but slightly depressed, with a terminal
  mouth, and a tapering diphycercal tail fringed above and below by a continuous caudal fin. A long
  dorsal fin, two small anal fins, and well-developed paired fins with contracted bases, are
  present. The head is armed with a prominent, serrated, dorsal spine, but it is doubtful if dermal
  denticles (shagreen) are present. The vertebral column <span class="pagenum" id="page439"><span
  class="smaller">{439}</span></span>is acentrous, and the persistent notochord supports a series of
  basidorsal cartilages, which alternate with small interdorsals, a series of basiventrals
  supporting small ribs, and in the caudal region well-developed haemal arches. The dorsal fin is
  supported by slender, tri-segmented radialia, which appear to be twice as numerous as the neural
  arches in the trunk; but in the dorsal lobe of the caudal fin the two structures agree in number.
  Ventrally-prolonged haemal spines are the sole endoskeletal supports of the inferior lobe of the
  caudal. The coraco-scapular cartilages of opposite sides remain distinct, and each supports a
  biserial fin. The pelvic girdle is represented by a pair of small cartilages supporting the
  basipterygia. The pelvic fins are uniserial, with post-axial skeletal supports for claspers in the
  males. Both the median and the paired fins are provided with marginal ceratotrichia. The skull is
  probably amphistylic. Five, possibly six or seven, branchial arches, bearing clusters of minute
  denticles, are present. Circumorbital plates are wanting. All the endoskeletal structures are
  partially calcified. The teeth are tricuspid, each with two long divergent lateral cusps and a
  minute median cusp; the broad bases of the teeth overlap and articulate with one another by means
  of facets.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Fam. 1. Pleuracanthidae.</b>&mdash;The single family included in the group
  ranges from the Lower Carboniferous to the Lower Permian. Within these limits the family is widely
  distributed in different formations in Great Britain, Continental Europe, New South Wales (Lower
  Hawkesbury Formation), and North America. <i>Pleuracanthus</i>, of which complete skeletons and
  skulls have been found, is the best known genus.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order III. Acanthodei.</b></p>

  <p>The Fishes comprising the Acanthodei<a id="NtA_525" href="#Nt_525"><sup>[525]</sup></a> may be
  regarded as a highly specialised and terminal offshoot from some primitive race of early
  Elasmobranchs. The Elasmobranch kinship of the Acanthodei is indicated by their exoskeleton of
  shagreen tubercles; the completely heterocercal tail; the absence of an operculum, the external
  gill-clefts apparently being exposed; the position of the lateral line of the trunk between two
  rows of shagreen denticles; the nature of the powerful spines in connexion with the dorsal and
  anal, and the pectoral and pelvic fins; and the formation of the hard parts of the skeleton, not
  by ossification involving the presence of bone-cells, but by the calcification of cartilage, or of
  more superficial membranous or fibrous tracts. On the other hand, it may be noted that the
  Acanthodei appear to have undergone much specialisation on lines in some respects parallel to
  those which have marked the evolution of the Teleostomi, but by methods which are simply an
  exaggeration of features normally characteristic of Elasmobranchs. Perhaps the most striking
  illustration of this is to be seen in the development of a species of secondary skull by an
  extension of a process of calcification as distinguished from ossification. Hence the presence of
  membrane-calcifications in relation with the upper and lower jaws, whose development is
  proportional to the size of the teeth they support, and of smaller investing plates of the cranial
  roof. Similar exoskeletal calcifications, when most completely developed (e.g.
  <i>Diplacanthus</i>), form a dorsally incomplete arch, apparently corresponding to a secondary
  pectoral girdle for the support of the stout pectoral spines, in which elements <span
  class="pagenum" id="page441"><span class="smaller">{441}</span></span>analogous to clavicles or
  cleithra and infra-clavicles can be recognised. Each pectoral spine forms the preaxial margin of
  the fin, and behind it there is a series of ceratotrichia. Nothing is known of the endoskeletal
  supports, but having regard to the nature and proportions of the pectoral spines it may be
  inferred that the exoskeletal elements of the fins predominate over the former to an extent which
  is only paralleled elsewhere in the Teleostei.</p>

  <p>Apparently the notochord is persistent, and there are long and slender neural and haemal
  arches, but no ribs. The dermal denticles are uniform in size, and so small as to give a granular
  appearance to the skin. In structure they are thick, with a flat, enamelled, often sculptured,
  external surface, quadrate or rhombic in shape, and fitting closely together. Teeth are either
  absent or very minute, but sometimes (e.g. <i>Acanthodopsis</i> and <i>Ischnacanthus</i>) they are
  few in number and large, conical in shape, occasionally with minute cusps between the larger
  teeth. Claspers are absent. The Acanthodei are small Fishes, most of them being less than .3 m. in
  length, and ranging from the Upper Silurian to the Lower Permian inclusive. Two families are
  recognised.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Diplacanthidae.</b>&mdash;Two dorsal fins are present. Usually there is a row of
  lateral spines extending along each side of the body between the pectoral and pelvic fins.
  Exclusively Upper Silurian and Devonian.</p>

  <p>The genera <i>Diplacanthus</i>, <i>Climatius</i>, <i>Parexus</i>, <i>Euthacanthus</i>, and
  <i>Ischnacanthus</i> are all found in the Lower Old Red Sandstone of Scotland. <i>Climatius</i>
  and <i>Diplacanthus</i> are also represented in the Devonian of Canada.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order IV. Plagiostomi.</b></p>

  <p class="sp3">Head prolonged in front of the ventrally-situated mouth as a more or less prominent
  preoral rostrum, vertebral column consisting of alternating basi- and inter-dorsal cartilages,
  generally supported by more or less well-developed chorda-centra. Pectoral and pelvic fins
  uniserial. Pelvic girdle and claspers present. Except in two families the branchial arches and
  clefts are invariably five in number. An operculum is not developed.<a id="NtA_526"
  href="#Nt_526"><sup>[526]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order 1. Selachii.</b></p>

  <p>Body elongate or fusiform, shading imperceptibly into a powerful swimming tail. Pectoral fins
  of moderate size, with contracted bases; not confluent with the sides of the head. Branchial
  clefts lateral in position. Vertebral centra generally asterospondylic or cyclospondylic.</p>

  <p>This sub-order includes such typical Elasmobranchs as the modern Sharks and Dog-Fishes as well
  as numerous fossil representatives ranging from the Carboniferous, and probably from still earlier
  periods, to the present day.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Notidanidae.</b>&mdash;Body moderately elongate, the spineless dorsal fin opposite
  the anal. Mouth ventral; nostrils ventral, near the extremity of the snout, without oro-nasal
  grooves. Branchial arches and clefts six or seven. Interbranchial septa devoid of marginal frills.
  Notochord persistent and continuous, partially constricted by simple chorda-centra, each
  consisting of two distinct rings, without either concentric or radial lamellae, except <span
  class="pagenum" id="page443"><span class="smaller">{443}</span></span>in one species (<i>Notidanus
  cinereus</i>), which exhibits a feeble asterospondylism in the caudal vertebrae. Skull
  amphistylic. Teeth unlike in the two jaws; those in the upper jaw usually with a large central
  cusp and smaller lateral cusps; those in the lower jaw comb-like, each consisting of numerous
  graduated pointed cusps inclining in the same direction, and supported on a long basal plate.</p>

  <p>The very few species included in this family are widely distributed in the tropical and
  subtropical regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. <i>Notidanus</i> (<i>Heptanchus</i>)
  <i>cinereus</i>, which has seven branchial arches and clefts, inhabits the Mediterranean and
  Atlantic. <i>N</i>. (<i>Hexanchus</i>) <i>griseus</i>, with six branchial arches and clefts, has a
  similar distribution, but besides being an occasional visitant to the British coasts, it is not
  uncommon at Cuba in the West Indies. It is said to grow to a length of 26 feet.</p>

  <p>Fossil remains of <i>Notidanus</i>, principally teeth, occur in the Middle and Upper Jurassic,
  in the Cretaceous, and in the Eocene and Pliocene of England and the Continent.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Chlamydoselachidae</b> (Frilled Sharks).&mdash;Body much elongate. Median fins as in
  <i>Notidanus</i>. Mouth nearly terminal. Nostrils lateral, nearly terminal, and without oro-nasal
  grooves. Branchial arches and clefts six. The outer margins of the interbranchial septa are
  produced into overlapping cutaneous frills, the first of which is developed from the hyoid arch
  and overlaps the hyobranchial cleft, like a rudimentary operculum. Vertebral column as in the
  preceding family, but in the hinder part of the trunk the notochord is unconstricted and uniform
  in diameter, centra being absent. Skull hyostylic. Lateral line an open groove. Teeth alike in
  both jaws, each consisting of a broad basal plate supporting three slender curved cusps, separated
  by a pair of much smaller cusps.</p>

  <p>The only living species known is <i>Chlamydoselachus anguineus</i> (Fig. 252),<a id="NtA_527"
  href="#Nt_527"><sup>[527]</sup></a> which occurs in the Pacific near Japan, in deep water off
  Madeira, and also off the Azores and the coast of Norway. It reaches a length of 4 to 5 feet.

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page444"><span class="smaller">{444}</span></span></div>

  <p>Scarcely anything is known of the habits of the Notidanidae and the Chlamydoselachidae. It is
  evident that they are closely-related forms, and from the unusual number of their gill-clefts and
  branchial arches, and the condition of the vertebral column, it is also obvious that they are the
  most archaic of modern Selachians.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Heterodontidae</b> (Bullhead Sharks).&mdash;Head large and high, with a blunt snout
  projecting but little in front of the small and almost terminal mouth, and with prominent
  supraorbital crests. Trunk thick-set and somewhat trihedral, covered with fine shagreen. Nostrils
  ventral but nearly terminal, with oro-nasal grooves. Spiracles small, beneath the eyes. Two dorsal
  fins, each with a spine in front, the first opposite the interval between the pectorals and
  pelvics, the second in front of the anal. Vertebral centra asterospondylic when fully developed.
  Palato-quadrate cartilages with an extensive articulation with the sides of the preorbital regions
  of the cranium, the normal suspensoria of a hyostylic skull (hyomandibular cartilages) taking
  little share in their support. Dentition similar in both jaws. Teeth at the symphyses numerous,
  small, and conical, furnished with three to five cusps in the young; those behind broad and
  pad-like, arranged in oblique rows, the teeth forming the two middle rows being much larger than
  those in the front or behind. Living species, oviparous. Egg-cases large, with an external spiral
  lamina (Fig. 245).</p>

  <p>About four species belonging to one genus, <i>Heterodontus</i> (= <i>Cestracion</i>) (Fig.
  253), or possibly to two, represent this dwindling family. All are inhabitants of the Pacific
  Ocean (Japan, Amboyna, Australia, the Galapagos, and the Californian coast of North America).
  Little is known of their habits. They feed <span class="pagenum" id="page445"><span
  class="smaller">{445}</span></span>principally on Molluscs, the shells of which are crushed by
  their massive grinding teeth. The different species vary in size from 2 to 5 feet.</p>

  <p>The Heterodontidae were the most characteristic and abundant Sharks of the Mesozoic period.
  Amongst extinct genera <i>Hybodus</i> ranges from the Middle Trias to the Lower Cretaceous
  (Wealden); an allied genus, <i>Acrodus</i>, from the Middle Trias to the Upper Cretaceous (Gault).
  <i>Palaeospinax</i> occurs in the Lias and possibly in the Upper Trias. <i>Synechodus</i> is a
  Cretaceous genus, and <i>Asteracanthus</i>, which has large hooked spines on the head, is
  characteristic of the Middle and Upper Jurassic. An even greater antiquity may be claimed for the
  Heterodontidae if, as is not improbable, such Palaeozoic Sharks as <i>Orodus</i>,
  <i>Sphenacanthus</i>, <i>Tristychius</i> (Carboniferous), and <i>Wodnika</i> (Permian) belong to
  this family. Many ichthyodorulites are probably the spines of various extinct Heterodontidae.</p>

  Palaeozoic family includes a number of Sharks probably related to the Heterodontidae, but of which
  little is known except their dentition. The teeth are in some respects similar to those of
  <i>Heterodontus</i>, except that those which appear to correspond to one or both of the middle
  rows of the latter genus tend to fuse and form a few large, convex, and often scroll-like plates.
  The typical Cochliodonts are exclusively Carboniferous (Europe and North America).
  <i>Psephodus</i>, <i>Pleuroplax</i>, <i>Deltodus</i>, <i>Poecilodus</i>, <i>Cochliodus</i>,
  <i>Deltoptychius</i>, <i>Helodus</i>, and <i>Menaspis</i> (Permian) are characteristic genera.
  <span class="pagenum" id="page446"><span class="smaller">{446}</span></span>Probably some
  ichthyodorulites described under various generic names belong to this family.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Psammodontidae.</b>&mdash;Teeth large, flat or slightly arched, oblong or quadrate,
  and arranged in one, two, or more longitudinal rows. Only the teeth are known, and from
  differences in their shape, size, and surface markings, the genera <i>Psammodus</i>,
  <i>Archeobatis</i>, and <i>Copodus</i> have been recognised. The family is confined to the Lower
  Carboniferous of Great Britain and Ireland, Russia, Belgium, and North America.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Petalodontidae.</b>&mdash;Teeth transversely elongated, with a blunt or a
  sharply-ridged crown, separated from a single or multiple root by a constricted neck, and disposed
  in transverse and longitudinal pavement-like rows; exoskeleton of smooth, oval, rounded or
  quadrate shagreen denticles. Only the teeth, and in some genera the dermal denticles, are known,
  except in <i>Janessa</i>, which has a Ray-shaped body, with large pectoral fins prolonged towards
  the head. The family is mainly confined to the Carboniferous formations of Great Britain, Europe,
  and North America. <i>Petalodus</i>, <i>Janessa</i> (also represented in the Permian),
  <i>Glossodus</i>, <i>Polyrhizodus</i>, and <i>Callopristodus</i> are characteristic genera.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Scylliidae</b> (Dog-Fishes).&mdash;Dorsal fins two in number, small, and without
  spines, the first above or behind the pelvic fins, the second usually behind the anal. Tail not
  bent upwards or but slightly so, without lateral keels. Spiracles present. Nictitating membranes
  absent. Vertebrae asterospondylic. Teeth small, each with a median cusp, and one to four small
  cusps on each side. Oviparous. Egg-cases (Fig. 246) large, quadrate, with long twining tendrils at
  the angles for attachment.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Scyllium</i> includes the true Dog-Fishes (Fig. 254). The species are coast Fishes
  of small or moderate size, and are widely distributed in temperate and tropical seas, at depths
  not as a rule exceeding 400 fathoms. Two species, <i>S. canicula</i> and <i>S. catulus</i>, are
  common on the British coasts, living near the bottom and feeding on Crustaceans and Molluscs. An
  allied form, <i>Pristiurus</i>, is also common in European and British waters.
  <i>Chiloscyllium</i> is a widely-distributed genus ranging from the Cape of Good Hope through the
  Indian Ocean to the coasts of Australia, China, and Japan. <i>Stegostoma tigrinum</i> of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page447"><span class="smaller">{447}</span></span>Indian Ocean attains a
  length of 10 to 15 feet, and is remarkable for its handsome coloration of dark bands on a yellow
  ground, which has suggested the name of Tiger- or Zebra-Shark. The pelagic genus
  <i>Ginglymostoma</i> has the terminal portion of the tail bent upwards, and grows to a length of 6
  to 12 feet. It is represented by species in the Indian Ocean and the tropical parts of the
  Atlantic (West Indies and the west coast of Mexico). <i>Crossorhinus</i> includes species of large
  size, some of which are 10 feet long. They are ground-sharks, frequenting the coasts of Australia
  and Japan, which lie on the bottom watching for their prey, and in accordance with this habit
  their coloration closely resembles that of their surroundings.<a id="NtA_529"

  <p>Most of the fossil Scylliidae belong to existing genera. The earliest known representatives of
  the family occur in the Upper Jurassic (Lithographic Stone of Bavaria), where the extinct genus

  Tertiary formations. A species of <i>Chiloscyllium</i> has been recorded from the Miocene
  Tertiaries, and detached teeth of <i>Ginglymostoma</i> from the Eocene of Belgium and North
  America. An extinct genus (<i>Mesiteia</i>), which is found in the Upper Chalk of Mount Lebanon

  with smooth, trenchant, or serrated margins, rarely with basal cusps; generally with an axial
  cavity when fully developed. Viviparous. The family comprises about twenty genera, and
  approximately sixty species; found in all seas, often in mid-ocean. Amongst the more important
  genera may be mentioned <i>Carcharias</i> (<i>Carcharhinus</i>), <i>Galeocerdo</i>,
  <i>Triakis</i>, <i>Thalassorhinus</i>, <i>Galeus</i>, <i>Mustelus</i> and
  <i>Scylliogaleus</i>.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 255.</span>&mdash;The Blue Shark (<i>Carcharias
      glaucus</i>). (From M&uuml;ller and Henle.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Species of <i>Carcharias</i> are found in nearly all tropical and subtropical seas. The genus
  is a somewhat comprehensive one, and groups of its species have been distinguished as sub-genera
  under the names of <i>Prionodon</i>, <i>Hypoprion</i>, <i>Scoliodon</i>, <i>Aprionodon</i>,<a
  id="NtA_531" href="#Nt_531"><sup>[531]</sup></a> etc. One of the most widely distributed of the
  thirty to forty species is the Blue Shark, <i>C</i>. (<i>Prionodon</i>) <i>glaucus</i> (Fig. 255),
  of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, which may grow to a length of 25 feet, although the young
  forms not infrequently captured in British waters do not exceed 6 to 8 feet. It is a slender,
  swift, pelagic Shark, of a slaty-blue colour above and white underneath, and a voracious hunter of
  other Fishes. <i>C. nicaraguensis</i>, a Shark about 7 feet long, is confined to Lake Nicaragua
  and its outlet the Rio San Juan, and is one of the very rare strictly freshwater Sharks.
  <i>Galeocerdo</i> is a large Shark found in temperate and tropical waters, but one species, <i>G.
  arcticus</i>, is confined to Arctic seas. The variegated <i>G. tigrinus</i>, or West Indian
  Tiger-Shark, is said <span class="pagenum" id="page449"><span
  class="smaller">{449}</span></span>to reach a length of 15 to 20 feet. The genus <i>Galeus</i>
  includes the small Sharks commonly known as "Topes," which are common in nearly all tropical and
  temperate seas. The British species, <i>G. canis</i>, which ranges from 4 to 6 feet in length, is
  a bottom-feeding Fish, preying on Molluscs, Crustacea, Star-Fish, and small Fishes. The various
  species of <i>Mustelus</i>, or "Hounds," resemble the Topes in their habits and distribution.
  Living principally on Molluscs and Crustaceans, the dentition has lost the trenchant, unicuspidate
  type characteristic of most other Carchariidae, and is adapted for crushing and grinding, the
  teeth being flat, without cusps, and arranged in pavement-like rows. Two species, <i>M.
  vulgaris</i> and <i>M. laevis</i>, are abundant on the coasts of Europe and the British Isles.
  <i>Scylliogaleus</i>, which combines the general characters of <i>Mustelus</i> with nostrils
  similar to those of a <i>Scyllium</i>, is known only from a single specimen from the coast of
  Natal.<a id="NtA_532" href="#Nt_532"><sup>[532]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Carchariidae are comparatively modern Sharks. No undoubted remains are known earlier than
  the Eocene, in which, as in the succeeding Miocene and Pliocene deposits, they are represented
  principally by their characteristic teeth. The extinct fossil genera are few in number, and so far
  as their dentition is concerned they differ but little from their living allies.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Sphyrnidae</b> (Hammer-head Sharks).&mdash;In their general characters the
  Hammer-head Sharks agree with the Carchariidae. They are distinguished, however, by the remarkable
  shape of the head, which is prolonged into two conspicuous lateral lobes, supported internally by
  corresponding cartilaginous outgrowths from the post-orbital and the lateral ethmoidal or nasal
  regions of the skull, with the eyes at their distal extremities, and the nostrils in relation with
  their anterior margins. One genus and five species.</p>

  <p>The Sphyrnidae are denizens of nearly all tropical and subtropical seas. <i>Sphyrna</i>
  (<i>Zygaena</i>) <i>tudes</i> occurs in the Mediterranean, and <i>S. zygaena</i> is a very rare
  visitant to the British coasts. A specimen over 13 feet in length was captured at Ilfracombe in
  1865, and other examples have been taken off Banffshire, at Newlyn in Cornwall, at Yarmouth, and
  in Carmarthen Bay.<a id="NtA_533" href="#Nt_533"><sup>[533]</sup></a> The shape of the head
  differs in different species, and in young <span class="pagenum" id="page450"><span
  class="smaller">{450}</span></span>forms the peculiarities of the adult are less marked. In the
  Bonnet Shark (<i>S. tiburo</i>) (Fig. 256, A), the head is crescentic or kidney-shaped, with
  prominent postero-lateral angles, and between this type of head and the more pronounced "hammer"
  of <i>S. zygaena</i> (Fig. 256, B) an almost perfect gradation is supplied by other species. The
  Hammer-heads are voracious Sharks, usually living in deep water, and they may grow to a length of
  15 feet. As many as thirty-seven embryos have been taken from the oviducts of a female nearly 11
  feet in length.<a id="NtA_534" href="#Nt_534"><sup>[534]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 10. Lamnidae</b> (Porbeagle Sharks).&mdash;Large, stout-bodied Sharks with two dorsal
  fins, the first just behind the pectoral fins, the second, which is small, opposite the small anal
  fin; both <span class="pagenum" id="page451"><span class="smaller">{451}</span></span>without
  spines. Tail with a prominent lateral keel on each side. Nictitating membranes absent. Spiracles
  minute or wanting. Branchial clefts very wide. No oro-nasal grooves. Vertebrae asterospondylic.
  When fully developed the teeth are solid.</p>

  <p>In the genus <i>Lamna</i>, which includes the Porbeagle Sharks, the teeth are large, each
  consisting of a long narrow central cusp, usually with smaller cusps at the base. The common
  Porbeagle (<i>L. cornubica</i>), a fierce pelagic Shark, which may reach a length of 10 feet,
  frequents the North Atlantic and the North Pacific (Fig. 257). It has often been captured off the
  coasts of Great Britain and Ireland in Mackerel or Salmon nets, or by lines laid for food Fishes.
  An allied genus, <i>Isurus</i>, is represented by species on the Atlantic coast of North America,
  in the Mediterranean and the neighbouring parts of the Atlantic, and also in Asiatic seas.
  <i>Carcharodon rondeletii</i><a id="NtA_535" href="#Nt_535"><sup>[535]</sup></a> is a pelagic
  Shark with large, triangular, finely-serrated teeth, without basal cusps, and is found in all
  tropical and subtropical seas from the Mediterranean to Australia and New Zealand. It is one of
  the largest and most formidable of Sharks, and it is said to grow to a length of 40 feet. Nothing
  is known of its breeding habits. <i>Odontaspis</i>, which has minute pore-like spiracles, but no
  lateral caudal keels, is a Shark of moderate size, chiefly inhabiting the Atlantic, but found also
  in the Mediterranean and the Southern Pacific. Its teeth are long and awl-like, with small basal
  cusps.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Thresher or Fox Shark (<i>Alopecias vulpes</i>) is remarkable for the extraordinary length
  of the upper lobe of the caudal fin, <span class="pagenum" id="page452"><span
  class="smaller">{452}</span></span>which is as long as the rest of the body (Fig. 258). Its teeth
  are of moderate size, triangular in shape, and without serrations. The "Thresher" has a wide
  distribution, being abundant in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, besides being the commonest of
  the larger Sharks frequenting the British coasts. It grows to a length of 15 feet, of which the
  tail forms at least one-half. Quite inoffensive to man, the Thresher feeds on the shoals of
  smaller Teleosts, such as Pilchards, Herrings, and Sprats. When feeding it swims in gradually
  diminishing circles round the shoal, splashing the water with its long tail, and keeping its
  victims so crowded together that they become an easy prey. A remarkable Lamnoid Shark
  (<i>Mitsukurina owstoni</i>),<a id="NtA_536" href="#Nt_536"><sup>[536]</sup></a> which has the
  snout produced into a "long, flat, flexible, leaf-like blade," somewhat resembling that of
  <i>Polyodon</i>, but narrower and more pointed, and has protractile jaws and large spiracles, is
  found in deep water near Yokohama, and may prove to be generically identical with the Cretaceous
  Shark <i>Scapanorhynchus</i>.<a id="NtA_537" href="#Nt_537"><sup>[537]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Lamnoid Sharks are not certainly known to have existed until the Upper Cretaceous formations,
  in which, as well as in different Tertiary deposits, teeth indistinguishable from those of the
  existing genera <i>Lamna</i>, <i>Odontaspis</i>, and <i>Carcharodon</i> are found. The interesting
  genus <i>Carcharodon</i> has one extinct species in the Cretaceous and several others distributed
  in Tertiary formations in nearly every part of the world. The teeth of some of the Tertiary
  species measure 5 inches along the margin and 4 inches across the base, and it is evident that
  they belonged to Sharks so gigantic as completely to dwarf the existing species. That these giant
  Lamnidae have only recently <span class="pagenum" id="page453"><span
  class="smaller">{453}</span></span>become extinct is proved by the fact that similar teeth have
  been dredged from the bottom of the Pacific. Teeth and detached vertebrae from various Tertiary
  deposits have been referred to species of <i>Alopecias</i>. Entire Fishes, with an elongated
  rostrum and an extensive anal fin, from the Cretaceous of Mount Lebanon, have been assigned to an
  extinct genus, <i>Scapanorhynchus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 11. Cetorhinidae</b> (Basking Sharks).&mdash;Two dorsal fins, without spines, the
  anterior midway between the pectoral and pelvic fins. Tail without lateral keels. Nictitating
  membranes absent. Spiracles small, situated just above the angles of the mouth. Branchial clefts
  wide and of great vertical extent, extending from the dorsal to the ventral surface. Teeth small,

  denticles.</p>

      (<i>Selache</i>) <i>maximus</i>). (From Goode and Bean.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The single species included in this family, the Basking Shark, (<i>Cetorhinus</i>
  (<i>Selache</i>) <i>maximus</i>), is one of the largest of living Fishes, reaching a length of 40
  feet (Fig. 259). It is a pelagic Shark, inhabiting the Arctic seas, but wandering as far south on
  opposite sides of the Atlantic as the Mediterranean, the coasts of Portugal and Virginia, and in
  the Pacific to the Californian coast. Although generally described as a northern form,
  <i>Cetorhinus</i> is known to occur in Australian waters.<a id="NtA_538"
  href="#Nt_538"><sup>[538]</sup></a> It is fairly common off the coasts of Scotland, and it has
  been seen or captured at various points on the western coast of Ireland, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page454"><span class="smaller">{454}</span></span>the eastern and southern coasts of England.
  The Fish is gregarious in its habits, often swimming in shoals near the surface. The name "Basking
  Shark" has been suggested by its habit of lying motionless on the surface in warm or calm weather,
  as if basking in the sun, with its dorsal fin protruding from the water. Unless attacked, this
  Shark is quiet and inoffensive. It derives its food-supply from small pelagic Fishes, and also
  from marine Invertebrates, which are strained from the water by the fringes of long, slender
  gill-rakers with which the branchial arches are provided. At one time harpooned and caught off the
  Irish, Scotch, and Norwegian coasts for the sake of the oil obtained from its liver, the Fish is
  now of little economic importance. Nothing is known of its mode of reproduction.</p>

  <p>Extinct species of <i>Cetorhinus</i> have been founded on detached vertebrae and isolated teeth
  from deposits of Pliocene age in Belgium and Italy, and possibly from still earlier Tertiary
  formations. Dermal spines similar to those found on the claspers of the males in the existing
  species occur in the Antwerp Crag, and in the Red Crag of Suffolk.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 12. Rhinodontidae.</b>&mdash;Two dorsal fins, without spines, the anterior a little in
  front of the pelvic fins, the second opposite the anal. Tail with lateral keels and a pit at its
  root. Spiracles small. Nictitating membranes absent. Mouth and nostrils nearly terminal. Teeth
  very minute, numerous, and conical in shape.</p>

  <p>One genus, <i>Rhinodon</i>, with one or two species, is known. These Sharks are very widely
  distributed, specimens having been seen or captured in the neighbourhood of Ceylon, at the
  Seychelles, the Cape of Good Hope, Callao on the Peruvian coast, in the Gulf of California, and
  off the coast of Florida. <i>Rhinodon</i> is probably the largest known Shark. It is stated to
  exceed 50 feet in length, but to be quite harmless. Scarcely anything is known of its habits, but
  the small size of the teeth, and the length of the gill-rakers, which resemble those of the
  Basking Shark, suggest a similar kind of food.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 13. Spinacidae.</b>&mdash;Two dorsal fins, the first in advance of the pelvic fins.
  Anal fin absent. Nictitating membrane absent. Spiracles rather large. Vertebrae cyclospondylic.
  Teeth variously modified in different genera.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page455"><span class="smaller">{455}</span></span></div>

  <p>The more typical representatives of this family are the Spiny Dog-Fishes, which are
  distinguished by the presence of a strong spine in front of each dorsal fin. They are more
  abundant in temperate regions than in the intervening tropics. The more important genera are
  <i>Acanthias</i>, <i>Centrina</i>, <i>Centrophorus</i>, <i>Spinax</i>, and <i>Centroscyllium</i>.
  <i>Acanthias vulgaris</i>, the Picked or Piked Dog-Fish, is a gregarious, voracious Shark, about 3
  to 4 feet in length, and is frequently seen in huge shoals all round the British coasts,
  especially during the summer months. It is very destructive to food Fishes, and its ravages result
  in serious loss to fishermen. <i>Acanthias</i> is viviparous. <i>Centrina salviani</i> is a much
  smaller Shark, which frequents the Mediterranean and the Bay of Biscay; on rare occasions it has
  been taken off the southern coast of England. <i>Centrophorus</i> occurs in deep water in the
  Mediterranean and adjacent portions of the Atlantic, and off the coasts of Japan.
  <i>Centroscyllium</i> is found on opposite sides of the North Atlantic (Greenland and
  Massachusetts), and in the opposite hemisphere at the Falkland Isles. A deep-water form,
  <i>Paracentroscyllium</i>, has been obtained in the Bay of Bengal at depths from 285 to 405
  fathoms.<a id="NtA_539" href="#Nt_539"><sup>[539]</sup></a></p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Three remaining genera (<i>Scymnus</i>, <i>Laemargus</i>, and <i>Echinorhinus</i>) differ from
  the preceding in the absence of dorsal spines.</p>

  <p><i>Scymnus lichia</i> is common in the Mediterranean and the neighbouring parts of the
  Atlantic. The Greenland Shark (<i>Laemargus borealis</i>) (Fig. 260) is an inhabitant of the
  Arctic regions, wandering as far southwards on opposite sides of the Atlantic as the French coast
  and Cape Cod. It is a huge, clumsy shark, reaching a length of 26 feet. Numerous instances are
  recorded of its capture off the coasts of Great Britain, especially in northern waters. The
  Greenland Shark is said to be a determined foe to <span class="pagenum" id="page456"><span
  class="smaller">{456}</span></span>the Right Whale, which it attacks, biting pieces out of its
  body. <i>Scymnus</i> is viviparous, <i>Laemargus</i> oviparous, and the latter is unique among
  Sharks in producing eggs devoid of a horny shell, which are deposited on the sea-bottom.
  <i>Echinorhinus</i> has dermal denticles in the form of relatively large rounded tubercles, each
  surmounted by a tuft of fine spines. One species only is known, <i>E. spinosus</i>, a large Shark
  attaining a length of 10 feet, and frequenting deep water off the Atlantic coasts of Europe and
  Africa from the North Sea to the Cape of Good Hope. A single specimen has been taken at Cape Cod
  on the eastern coast of the United States, and another off Dunedin, New Zealand. The capture of
  thirty examples in British waters since 1828 has been recorded,<a id="NtA_540"
  href="#Nt_540"><sup>[540]</sup></a> the largest a female 9 feet in length.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 14. Rhinidae</b> (Angel-Sharks).&mdash;Ray-like Sharks with a flattened head and body,
  and nearly terminal mouth and nostrils. Pectoral fins very large, horizontally expanded, but
  constricted at the base and not adherent to the sides of the head or trunk. Two dorsal fins, both
  small, without spines, and situated on the tail behind the pelvic fins. Anal fin absent. Spiracles
  large <span class="pagenum" id="page457"><span class="smaller">{457}</span></span>and crescentic.
  Vertebrae tectospondylic. Teeth conical and pointed. A single species only is known.</p>

  <p><i>Rhina squatina</i>, the Angel-Shark or Monk-Fish (Fig. 261), is intermediate between the
  ordinary Sharks and the Skates and Rays, both in external appearance and internal structure, but
  is more Ray-like than Shark-like in its habits. Within the temperate and tropical regions of both
  hemispheres it is almost cosmopolitan in its distribution, frequenting the coasts of Europe,
  including the British Isles, the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America, and the shores of
  South Australia and Japan. The Angel-Shark is viviparous, producing about twenty young at a time.
  Not rarely it grows to a length of 5 feet.</p>

  <p>The family ranges from the Upper Jurassic to the present time. Species of <i>Rhina</i> are
  represented by more or less complete skeletons in the Lithographic Stone of Bavaria, and in the
  Upper Cretaceous of Westphalia and Mount Lebanon, and by teeth and vertebrae in the English Chalk,
  as well as in different European Tertiary formations.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 15. Pristiophoridae.</b>&mdash;Prenasal portion of the head and cranium produced into a
  long flattened rostrum, furnished with a pair of long tentacles on its under surface, and, as in
  Saw-Fishes, with a series of large, tooth-like, dermal denticles, of equal or unequal size, along
  each of its lateral margins. Two dorsal fins, without spines, the first in front of the pelvics.
  No anal fin. Pectoral fins large, distinct from the head and trunk, with a contracted base.
  Spiracles large and crescentic. Teeth small, with a conical cusp and a broad base.</p>

  <p>These singular Sharks closely resemble the true Saw-Fishes (Pristidae), but they differ in the
  lateral position of their gill-clefts, the presence of rostral tentacles, and their smaller size.
  The few species known belong to the genus <i>Pristiophorus</i>, and are confined to the Australian
  and Japanese seas.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Pristiophorus</i> is represented in the Upper Cretaceous of Mount Lebanon, and
  in the Miocene deposits.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order 2. Batoidei.</b></p>

  <p>Body generally discoidal or rhombic in shape, the axial portion being formed by the flattened
  head and trunk, and the lateral portions by the enormously expanded pectoral fins, which <span
  class="pagenum" id="page458"><span class="smaller">{458}</span></span>are usually confluent with
  the sides of the head. Tail slender, sharply marked off from the trunk, to which it usually
  appears as a mere appendage. Dorsal fins, when present, on the tail. Anal fin absent. Branchial
  clefts ventral in position. Spiracles large, usually crescentic. Vertebrae tectospondylic.</p>

  <p>For the most part the Batoidei are sluggish ground-Fishes, slowly moving over the sea-bottom by
  the gentle undulatory vibrations of the margins of their huge pectoral fins, the tail being of
  little use in locomotion. They feed principally on Crustacea, Molluscs, and the smaller Teleosts.
  As with other Fishes of similar habits, the coloration of the dorsal surface harmonises with that
  of the sea-bottom, while the ventral surface is either deficient in pigment or white. The majority
  of them are coast Fishes, rarely descending to a greater depth than 500 fathoms, but some are
  pelagic. The Batoidei are a relatively modern race, first appearing towards the middle of the
  Mesozoic period, and evidently representing an assemblage of specialised Elasmobranchs adapted for
  a bottom-living existence. As remarked by Smith Woodward, the three families, Rhinobatidae,
  Raiidae, and Trygonidae, are not so clearly differentiated before the close of the Cretaceous
  period as they subsequently become.<a id="NtA_541" href="#Nt_541"><sup>[541]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The first two families, the Pristidae and the Rhinobatidae, are interesting connecting-links
  between such Selachii as the Rhinidae and the Pristiophoridae and the more specialised Batoidei
  like the Skates, Rays, and Trygons. While they agree with the latter in the ventral position of
  the gill-clefts, the absence of an anal fin, and the caudal position of the dorsal fins, the body
  still retains an elongated and somewhat Shark-like shape, and shades off imperceptibly into a
  powerful swimming tail, and in the Pristidae at all events the pectoral fins are of moderate size
  and free from any fusion with the sides of the head. It must be admitted that the institution of
  the two sub-orders introduces a somewhat arbitrary distinction between certain families of
  Plagiostomes which has little to recommend it except custom and some measure of convenience. The
  two series of Fishes shade almost imperceptibly into one another, and the importance of the
  ventral position of the gill-clefts has probably been overestimated. Primitively, the gill-clefts
  are lateral, and lie wholly in front of the pectoral fins, a position which is retained in many
  <span class="pagenum" id="page459"><span class="smaller">{459}</span></span>Selachii. In others,
  however, the hinder gill-clefts tend to extend backwards above the base of the pectoral fins,
  while in some the clefts assume a more ventral position, and extend beneath the pectoral fin;
  hence, even within the limits of the Selachii the position of the gill-clefts varies to the extent
  that these structures may be lateral, or they may tend to become either dorsal or ventral.<a
  id="NtA_542" href="#Nt_542"><sup>[542]</sup></a> On the score of convenience the customary usage
  is adopted here.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Pristidae</b> (True Saw-Fishes).&mdash;Although somewhat depressed, the body is
  still elongate and Shark-like, with a well-developed tail terminating in a heterocercal caudal
  fin. Dorsal fins large, the first opposite the pelvic fins. Head and skull prolonged into a long
  flattened rostrum, the lateral margins of which are armed with a series of strong tooth-like
  denticles, firmly implanted in sockets in the calcified rostral cartilage. No rostral tentacles.
  Teeth in the jaws minute and obtuse. One genus and about four or five species are known, all
  inhabitants of tropical and subtropical seas.</p>

  <p>Some of the true Saw-Fishes attain a considerable size, 10 to 20 feet or even longer, and
  "saws" 6 feet long and a foot in width across the base are not uncommon. By means of powerful
  lateral strokes of its saw the Fish is capable of lacerating the bodies of other animals and
  tearing off pieces of flesh, which it then devours. Indian species are known to ascend rivers
  beyond tidal influence, and an American species, ranging northwards to the West Indies and the
  Gulf of Mexico, where it is abundant, enters the lower Mississippi. <i>P. antiquorum</i> occurs in
  the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, but does not extend so far northward as the British
  coasts.</p>

  <p>The earliest known representative of the family is the <span class="pagenum" id="page460"><span
  class="smaller">{460}</span></span>extinct genus <i>Sclerorhynchus</i> from the Upper Chalk of
  Mount Lebanon, in which the smaller size and more superficial position of the rostral "teeth," and

  existing genus <i>Pristis</i> from the English Middle Eocene, are also known.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Rhinobatidae.</b>&mdash;Owing to the increased expansion of the pectoral fins and
  the forward growth of their anterior cutaneous portions along the sides of the head, as well as
  backwards along the trunk, the body now assumes a sub-rhombic shape, and approximates to the disc
  of the more typical Batoidei, but the tail with its dorsal and caudal fins is still strongly
  developed, and blends imperceptibly with the trunk in front. Teeth very obtuse. No electric
  organs. About five genera and twenty species are known, distributed in most tropical and
  subtropical seas.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Raiidae</b> (Skates or Rays).&mdash;The endoskeletally supported portions of the
  large pectoral fins extend along the lateral margins of the trunk and head from the pelvic fins to
  the snout, and are confluent therewith, forming the lateral portions of a large rhombic disc. The

  </div>

  <p>The great majority of the species belong to the genus <i>Raia</i> (Fig. 264), which chiefly
  inhabits temperate seas, but is more abundant in the northern than in the southern hemisphere, and
  approaches nearer to the Arctic and Antarctic regions than any other Batoidei. The colour of the
  upper surface of the body is closely assimilated to that of the sandy or gravelly bottom on <span
  class="pagenum" id="page462"><span class="smaller">{462}</span></span>which they live, and thus
  concealed, small Fishes, Crustaceans, and other organisms are lured unsuspectingly within the
  reach of the comparatively inactive and sluggish Ray. From the ventral position of the mouth the
  Ray cannot at once seize its prey, but the Fish darts over its victim and covers it with its body,
  and then readily devours it. The sexes are usually distinguished by secondary sexual characters,
  which take the form of differences in size and coloration, in the dentition, and also in the
  presence and position of patches or rows of specially modified dermal spines on the dorsal surface
  (Fig. 264). Some of the larger species reach a great size, the disc measuring 7 to 8 feet in
  width. A few species range into deep water. <i>R. mamillidens</i>, a uniformly jet-black species,
  has been obtained from a depth of 597 fathoms in the Bay of Bengal,<a id="NtA_543"

  <p>The family ranges from the Upper Cretaceous, in which, as well as in different Tertiary
  deposits, it is represented by species of <i>Raia</i>. An extinct genus, <i>Cyclobatis</i>, with a

  type seems to be intermediate between the modern Sharks and the Rays.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Torpedinidae</b> (Electric Rays).&mdash;A disc is formed as in the Raiidae, but it
  is sub-circular in shape rather than rhombic, and in the nature of its endoskeletal supports it is
  in some respects unique. Its semicircular anterior margin is supported <span class="pagenum"
  id="page463"><span class="smaller">{463}</span></span>in the centre by a branched prenasal
  rostrum, and laterally by the curiously branched preorbital cartilages, each of which radiates
  outwards and forwards from a common basal articulation with the lateral ethmoid regions of the
  skull. Tail relatively short and thick, with two dorsal fins, a caudal fin, and two lateral
  longitudinal folds. Skin smooth, without denticles. Mouth transverse and ventral. A characteristic
  quadrangular naso-frontal lobe, with a free hinder margin, which forms the anterior lip, is
  enclosed by the two nasal organs and the oro-nasal grooves leading from them to the corresponding
  angles of the mouth. A pair of large electric organs between the pectoral fins and the head. Seven
  genera and about fifteen species. Inhabitants of most warm seas.</p>

  <p>The well-known genus <i>Torpedo</i> (Fig. 265) is represented by species in the Mediterranean
  (<i>T. marmorata</i>, <i>T. narce</i>, <i>T. hebetans</i>), the Red Sea, and the Atlantic and
  Pacific Oceans. <i>T. hebetans</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page464"><span
  class="smaller">{464}</span></span>has been taken at several places in British waters. An American
  <i>Torpedo</i> (<i>Tetronarce</i>) is represented by species on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.
  <i>Narcine</i> is a very widely distributed genus, species having been recorded from the East
  Indies, Tasmania, China, Japan, South Africa, and the Atlantic coasts of North and South America.
  <i>Discopyge</i> is an eastern Pacific genus (Peru and Panama). <i>Hypnos</i> frequents the
  Australian seas.</p>

  <p>The family seems to be exclusively Tertiary, and its earliest fossil representatives are from
  the Upper Eocene of Monte Bolca.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Trygonidae</b> (Sting- or Whip-tailed Rays).&mdash;Disc sub-rhombic, broader than
  long. Pectoral fins confluent with the sides of the head, their preaxial endoskeletal radialia
  meeting in front of the skull along the lateral margins of a slender prenasal rostral cartilage.
  Tail usually whip-like, terminating in a small caudal fin, and generally armed with a sharp,
  serrated spine, which takes the place of a dorsal fin. Skin smooth or spinose. A rectangular
  naso-frontal flap in front of the mouth. About ten genera and fifty species. Found in nearly all
  tropical and subtropical seas.</p>

  <p>Of the more important genera, <i>Trygon</i> (<i>Dasyatis</i>) is represented by numerous
  species in the tropical parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, including the Pacific coasts of
  North and South America. Two species occur in the Mediterranean, and one of them (<i>T.
  pastinaca</i>), ranges from the coasts of Norway and the British Isles through the Atlantic and
  Indian Oceans to Japan. <i>Urogymnus</i> frequents the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean.
  <i>Urolophus</i> includes a few species of small size, distributed along the Atlantic and Pacific
  coasts of Central and North America, and in Australian seas. <i>Pteroplatea</i> comprises rather
  large species, and is almost cosmopolitan in its distribution, being represented by species on the
  Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North and South America, in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, the
  Indian Ocean, the Malay Archipelago, and on the coasts of China and Japan. The caudal spines,
  which may be 8 to 9 inches long in some of the larger species, are capable of inflicting very
  severe wounds, the danger of which is greatly increased by the apparently poisonous cutaneous
  mucus introduced into the wound. As the spines become lost they are replaced by others developed
  from behind. Some Trygonidae live in fresh waters. <i>Trygon</i> (<i>Dasyatis</i>) <i>sabina</i>
  frequents the streams and estuaries of Florida <span class="pagenum" id="page465"><span
  class="smaller">{465}</span></span>as well as on the adjacent coasts, and specimens have been
  obtained from Lake Munroe at some distance from salt water.<a id="NtA_547"
  href="#Nt_547"><sup>[547]</sup></a> <i>Ellipesurus</i> and <i>Paratrygon</i> are freshwater
  genera, found in Colombia, Venezuela, and Guiana.</p>

  <p>Fossil remains of undoubted Trygonidae appear to be confined to the Tertiary period.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Myliobatidae</b> (Eagle-Rays).&mdash;Disc much broader than long, and rhombic in
  shape. The huge pectoral fins are not continued to the extremity of the snout, but cease on the
  sides of the head, and reappear in front of the snout as a pair of distinct folds, the so-called
  cephalic fins. The head projects above the level of the disc, and consequently the eyes and
  spiracles are lateral in position. Tail long, slender, and whip-like, with a single dorsal fin
  near the root, and usually one or two serrated spines behind the fin. A rectangular naso-frontal
  fold is present. The dentition consists of flat, hexagonal, pavement-like crushing teeth arranged
  from before backward in arched rows in both jaws, and there is either a single median row of large
  teeth, with (e.g. <i>Myliobatis</i>) or without (e.g. <i>A&euml;tobatis</i>) the addition of several
  rows of much smaller teeth on each side, or there are numerous rows, the teeth then decreasing in
  size from the middle line laterally (e.g. <i>Rhinoptera</i>). Skin smooth. Sexes similar. Five
  genera and about twenty-seven species are known; all inhabitants of tropical and subtropical
  seas.</p>

  <p><i>Myliobatis</i> is represented in the Mediterranean by two species, and one of them, the
  almost cosmopolitan <i>M. aquila</i> (Fig. 266), has been taken at various points on the eastern
  and southern coasts of England. <i>A&euml;tobatis</i> is also widely distributed in tropical seas, but
  is unknown in European waters. <i>Rhinoptera</i> has one species in the Mediterranean, while
  others have been recorded from Brazil, the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America, and the
  East Indies. The two tropical genera <i>Dicerobatis</i> and <i>Ceratoptera</i> have the cephalic
  fins prolonged anteriorly into a pair of horn-like appendages, which are said to be used in
  conveying food to the mouth. The teeth are small, flat or tubercular, and are arranged in numerous
  rows. In <i>Ceratoptera</i> they are wanting in the upper jaw. The Eagle-Rays feed principally on
  Molluscs, the shells of which they crush with their large grinding-teeth. Some of them attain
  <span class="pagenum" id="page466"><span class="smaller">{466}</span></span>an enormous size, and
  are among the largest of Fishes. <i>Ceratoptera vampyrus</i> of the West Indies, for example,
  grows to a width of 20 feet, and an embryo extracted from the oviduct of a gravid female 15 feet
  wide, and from 3 to 4 feet in thickness, measured 5 feet across the disc and weighed twenty
  pounds.<a id="NtA_548" href="#Nt_548"><sup>[548]</sup></a> This Fish is much dreaded by the divers

  <p class="sp3">The family is exclusively Tertiary, and with the exception of an extinct genus,

  existing genera <i>Myliobatis</i>, <i>Rhinoptera</i>, and <i>A&euml;tobatis</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order V. Holocephali</b></p>

  <p>The propriety of including the Holocephali in the sub-class Elasmobranchii is scarcely open to
  doubt. Like the Acanthodei <span class="pagenum" id="page467"><span
  class="smaller">{467}</span></span>they seem to represent a divergent and specialised offshoot
  from some primitive Elasmobranch type, and while retaining most of the essentially distinctive
  features of their ancestors, they have acquired, perhaps independently, certain characters
  distinctive of the Teleostomi, combined with others peculiar to themselves. In the few surviving
  genera agreement with the Elasmobranchs is to be seen in the wholly cartilaginous condition of the
  endoskeleton and the complete absence of cartilage- and membrane-bones. The vertebral column is
  acentrous and ribless, and the notochord is persistent; the dorsal arcualia include supradorsals
  and regularly alternating basi- and inter-dorsals. The limbs and limb-girdles are essentially
  Elasmobranch. Dermal denticles are present, either locally, or, as in some of the fossil types, in
  the form of a general investment. The brain and the reproductive organs agree more closely with
  the corresponding structures in the Elasmobranchs than with those of any other Fishes, and the
  agreement extends to the large size of the eggs and their enclosure in horny egg-cases. In both
  groups the nostrils are connected with the mouth by oro-nasal grooves; the hyoidean hemibranch is
  a true gill, and there is no air-bladder. The Holocephali also agree with the Elasmobranchs in
  retaining such primitive features as an intestinal spiral valve and a conus arteriosus. On the
  other hand, indications of specialisation in the Teleostome direction are to be noticed in the
  tendency to the concentration of the branchial arches towards and beneath the skull; the reduction
  of the interbranchial septa to the extent that they are no longer continuous with the skin, and
  the gill-filaments project beyond their outer margins; the presence of an operculum; the
  suppression of the spiracles; and the absence of a cloaca, the rectum opening externally by an
  anus in front of the urino-genital apertures. Among the more notable features evolved within the
  limits of the group mention may be made of the autostylic condition of the skull, probably an
  adaptive modification induced by the large size of the crushing dental plates which have taken the
  place of ordinary teeth; and the singular development of anterior and frontal "claspers."</p>

  <p>The group is one of great antiquity. Apart from the isolated spines or "ichthyodorulites"
  common in Devonian and Carboniferous strata, some of which are probably the frontal or the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page468"><span class="smaller">{468}</span></span>fin-spines of ancient
  Holocephali, dental plates, closely resembling those of modern Chimaeroids and referred to the
  Ptychodontidae, are probably the earliest indications of the existence of the group. The
  Holocephali become more abundant in the Mesozoic period, but of the four families usually
  recognised, only one, the Chimaeridae, has survived.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Ptyctodontidae.</b>&mdash;This Palaeozoic family is known only by the dental plates,
  of which there is a single pair in each jaw, meeting at the symphysis. <i>Ptyctodus</i><a
  id="NtA_550" href="#Nt_550"><sup>[550]</sup></a> and <i>Rhynchodus</i> occur in the Devonian of
  either Russia or Germany, and in North America, and <i>Palaeomylus</i> only in the Devonian of
  North America.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Squaloraiidae.</b>&mdash;General shape of the body similar to the existing
  <i>Harriotta</i>. There is a long, depressed, preoral rostrum, and in the male the head carries a
  long slender frontal spine. Conical denticles are sparsely present on the head and body. No dorsal
  fin-spine. Dental plates similar to those of the living Chimaeroids, but thinner, the tritoral
  areas being less well defined. The only genus is <i>Squaloraia</i> from the English Lias, of which
  nearly complete skeletons are known.<a id="NtA_551" href="#Nt_551"><sup>[551]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Myriacanthidae.</b><a id="NtA_552" href="#Nt_552"><sup>[552]</sup></a>&mdash;Body
  elongate, but less depressed. A dorsal fin-spine is present, and in the males a frontal spine. The
  dentition consists of a median incisor-like tooth at the symphysis of the lower jaw, in addition
  to dental plates similar to those of <i>Squaloraia</i>. There is a symmetrical series of
  tuberculated dermal plates on the lateral surfaces of the head, which probably represent groups of
  fused denticles. One species (<i>Myriacanthus granulatus</i>) has its rostrum terminating in a
  cutaneous flap, as in <i>Callorhynchus</i>. <i>Myriacanthus</i>, from the Lower Lias of Lyme
  Regis, and <i>Chimaeropsis</i>, from the Lithographic Stone of Bavaria, are the only two
  genera.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Chimaeridae.</b>&mdash;Body elongate and shark-like in form, but the head is
  compressed and the mouth is small. Pectoral and pelvic fins large, especially the former, which
  are somewhat ventrally placed. Two dorsal fins, the anterior over the pectorals, with a stout
  spine in front; and a small anal fin. Dermal denticles restricted to the claspers, and to
  localised areas <span class="pagenum" id="page469"><span class="smaller">{469}</span></span>on the
  dorsal surface in young forms. Dental plates large and thick, including a single pair in the lower
  jaw and two pairs, vomerine and palatine teeth, above, which combine trenchant edges with
  well-marked grinding areas. Three genera are known.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In <i>Chimaera</i> (Fig. 267) the mouth and nostrils are ventral, posterior to a bluntly
  conical snout. Head surmounted in the males by a club-shaped appendage armed with a pad of
  recurved denticles, the frontal clasper; there is also an anterior clasper armed with similar
  denticles and retractile into a shallow glandular pouch in front of each pelvic fin, in addition
  to the ordinary clasper behind the fin. The caudal fin consists of nearly equal-sized dorsal and
  ventral lobes, between which the slightly up-tilted caudal axis is prolonged as a long tapering
  filament: hence the tail appears to be nearly diphycercal. <i>C. monstrosa</i> occurs off the
  coasts of Europe from Norway to Portugal, including the Mediterranean, and also in the
  neighbourhood of the Azores, as far south as the Cape of Good Hope, and eastwards off the coast of
  Japan. It is the largest of the living species, reaching a length of 3 feet. <i>C. affinis</i> was
  first taken off the coast of Portugal, and subsequently on the North American side of the
  Atlantic, at depths ranging from 200 to 1200 fathoms. <i>C</i>. (<i>Hydrolagus</i>) <i>colliei</i>
  is restricted to the North Pacific, and is especially plentiful off South-eastern Alaska, and
  about the wharves at Esquimalt. Unlike most other Chimaeroids this species swims at the surface,
  and there is no evidence that it is a deep-sea form. In its breeding habits, and in the mode in
  which its eggs are fertilised, <i>Chimaera</i> probably resembles the oviparous Sharks and
  Dog-Fishes.</p>

  <p>The eggs appear to be deposited on the sea-bottom in deep water, but they are very rarely
  obtained. An egg-case dredged up off the south-west coast of Ireland, at a depth of 315 fathoms,
  and about 6&frac12; inches in length, is shown in Fig. 268.<a id="NtA_553"
  href="#Nt_553"><sup>[553]</sup></a> It consisted of a broad, somewhat oval, flattened portion
  which contained the egg, and terminated at one end in a truncated margin, while at the other it
  was produced into a long tapering styliform process, traversed by dorsal, ventral, and lateral
  ridges. The cavity of the egg-case was open in front, and also along each side, where linear,
  slit-like valvular apertures freely admitted sea-water into the central cavity. A similar egg-case
  from Japan, measuring 9 inches in length, had its surface traversed by longitudinal and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page471"><span class="smaller">{471}</span></span>transverse ridges, and no
  doubt belonged to a Japanese <i>Chimaera</i>.<a id="NtA_554" href="#Nt_554"><sup>[554]</sup></a>
  In neither egg-case was there any trace of tendrils. The eggs probably lie on the sea-bottom, or,
  when the cases have styliform prolongations, it is possible that they are implanted in the
  ooze.</p>

  <p><i>Callorhynchus</i> (Fig. 269) is distinguished by a singular prolongation of the rostrum,
  which terminates in a downwardly-directed cutaneous flap, evidently from its abundant nerve-supply
  an important tactile organ. A frontal clasper is present in the male. The prolonged caudal axis is
  up-tilted, and the tail is more distinctly heterocercal than in <i>Chimaera</i>. The only species,
  <i>C. antarcticus</i>, is confined to the Antarctic basin and the South Pacific. The egg-cases of
  <i>Callorhynchus</i> differ considerably from those of <i>Chimaera</i>, and so large are they that
  one may measure 25 cm. in length, or nearly as long as the abdominal cavity of the Fish. Each case
  is ovoid in shape, surrounded by a wide flat margin which is covered on one side with yellow
  hair-like fibres, thus giving to the case a protective resemblance to a mass of seaweed (Fig.
  270). In the central part of the case there is a pear-shaped cavity in which the egg or the embryo
  is contained. From one end of this cavity a passage, guarded by a valve, leads to the exterior,
  and provides for the escape of the young. While in the egg-case the nearly ripe embryo has long
  external gills, and its body is nearly sessile on a large and singularly lobed yolk-sac.</p>

  <p>The third genus, <i>Harriotta</i> (Fig. 271),<a id="NtA_555"

  the youngest examples at present known (Fig. 272, A), is not uptilted, although the lower lobe of
  the caudal fin is much larger than the upper. Young forms have a double row of stout spine-like
  denticles in front of the second dorsal fin, and also in the interval between the latter and the
  upper caudal lobe. Similar denticles are also present on the upper surface of the head between the
  orbits (Fig. 272). <i>H. raleighana</i> is found in the North Atlantic. Individuals varying in
  length from 4 to 25 inches have been taken at depths ranging from 707 to 1081 fathoms. A species

  <p>With the probable exception of <i>Chimaera colliei</i> the surviving Holocephali are denizens

  the youngest specimen of <i>Harriotta</i> was obtained from 991 fathoms. Egg-cases are rarely
  obtained, and then only from considerable depths. It is therefore reasonable to <span
  class="pagenum" id="page474"><span class="smaller">{474}</span></span>infer that these Fishes
  breed in deep water. As might be expected, little is known of the embryology of any of the
  Holocephali, but that little adds further proof of the Elasmobranch relationship of the group. The
  segmentation of the egg of <i>Chimaera</i> and the overgrowth of the yolk by a circular blastoderm
  are essentially as in Elasmobranchs. The early embryos are said to be shark-like, and to possess
  both spiracles and "external gills," and the primary upper jaw is less completely confluent with
  the skull than in the adult. It is also said that the palatine dental plates are represented at an
  early stage by series of small, more or less conical elements, which, outwardly at least, resemble
  the rudiments of the grinding teeth of the Cestraciont Sharks.<a id="NtA_558"
  href="#Nt_558"><sup>[558]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="sp5">The Chimaeridae first appear in the Lower Oolites, and attain their maximum

  <i>Ganodus</i> is an Oolitic genus. <i>Ischyodus</i> ranges from the Lower Oolites to the Lower

  <i>Elasmodus</i> ranges from the Upper Cretaceous into the Eocene. Teeth of the existing genus
  <i>Callorhynchus</i> occur in the Cretaceous of New Zealand, and of <i>Chimaera</i> in the Upper
  Tertiary of Europe and Java. The fossil Holocephali afford little evidence of the origin of the
  group from more typical or more primitive Elasmobranchs. So far as their structure is known, they
  all possess the essentially distinctive features of their modern representatives, and offer little
  evidence of transitional forms. The surviving Chimaeroids seem to have acquired a more specialised
  dentition, but in other respects they are either more primitive, or possibly somewhat
  degenerate.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Class II. Teleostomi.</b></p>

  <p>In this group of Fishes the primary upper and lower jaws (palato-quadrate and Meckelian
  cartilages) are supplemented by the addition of certain tooth-bearing membrane bones which form
  secondary jaws corresponding to the functional jaws of the higher Craniates.<a id="NtA_560"
  href="#Nt_560"><sup>[560]</sup></a> The chondrocranium and the primary jaws are usually more or
  less completely ossified by cartilage bones, and there is always a secondary cranium of dermal
  bones, of which paired parietals and frontals above, and a median vomer and a parasphenoid below,
  are amongst the most constant. The skull is hyostylic. An operculum covering the gill-clefts and
  supported by a special opercular skeleton is a constant feature. The vertebral column is often
  acentrous, and when centra are present they are invariably arch-centra. There is a well-developed
  secondary pectoral girdle, connected dorsally with the hinder part of the skull. As a rule the
  pelvic girdle is absent altogether, and when present it is rarely more than a rudiment or a
  vestige. The endoskeletal supports of the paired fins are uniserial. The dermal fin-rays of the
  paired and median fins are probably modified scales or lepidotrichia. In the median fins the
  fin-rays are at first more numerous than their supporting radials, but in the more specialised
  Teleostomes they ultimately equal them in number. The body is usually invested by an exoskeleton
  of articulated rhombic or imbricated cycloid scales. Claspers are unknown. In the surviving
  members of the group there is usually an <span class="pagenum" id="page476"><span
  class="smaller">{476}</span></span>air-bladder. The gill-filaments project freely beyond the outer
  edges of the greatly reduced interbranchial septa. The external opening of each nasal sac is
  usually divided into two distinct apertures, and there is no oro-nasal groove leading from the sac
  to the mouth. The brain has no proper cerebral hemispheres, but retains an undivided
  prosencephalon with a non-nervous roof. A cloaca is not developed, the rectum opening externally
  by an anus in front of, and distinct from, the separate or united urino-genital apertures. The ova
  are small and numerous, and the segmentation is either holoblastic and unequal, or meroblastic.
  Besides a large number of fossil forms the group includes the vast majority of living Fishes.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Teleostomi include four "Orders," the <span class="sc">Crossopterygii</span>,
  the <span class="sc">Chondrostei</span>, the <span class="sc">Holostei</span>, and the <span
  class="sc">Teleostei</span>. Of these the Crossopterygii occupy a remarkably central position.
  Remotely connected with the Elasmobranchs on the one hand, and more intimately related to the
  Holostei and Teleostei on the other, they also probably represent the ancestral stock from which
  the Stegocephalan Amphibia and the Dipneusti have had their origin. Of the three remaining groups,
  often collectively spoken of as "Actinopterygii," the Chondrostei are the oldest and most
  primitive. Like the Crossopterygii, they are not without evidence of a remote kinship with the
  Elasmobranchs, but in a broad general sense they also represent the initial stages in a sequence
  of structural modifications, of which the Teleostei, the dominant Fishes of the present day, are
  the final outcome.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order I. Crossopterygii.</b></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pectoral fins obtusely lobate and probably uniserial, or acutely lobate and
  probably biserial. Pelvic fins abdominal in position, uniserial, non-lobate, or obtusely lobate.
  Scales rhombic or cycloid, and, like the dermal cranial bones, they are generally invested by a
  layer of enamel-like ganoin. Tail heterocercal, or apparently diphycercal or gephyrocercal.
  Vertebral column acentrous, or with ring-like centra, or even with complete bony amphicoelous
  centra. Lower jaw with dentigerous splenials. As a rule, the opercular series includes an
  operculum and a suboperculum. Branchiostegal rays absent, their place being taken by a remarkable
  armature of jugular plates (Fig. 274). Secondary pectoral girdle <span class="pagenum"
  id="page477"><span class="smaller">{477}</span></span>complete, including a pair of
  infra-clavicles. With rare exceptions the fin-rays of the median fins retain their numerical
  preponderance over the supporting radials. The group is divisible into two "sub-orders," the <span
  class="sc">Osteolepida</span> and the <span class="sc">Cladistia</span>.<a id="NtA_561"
  href="#Nt_561"><sup>[561]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order 1. Osteolepida.</b></p>

  <p>The obtusely or acutely lobate pectoral fins articulate with the pectoral girdle by a single
  basal endoskeletal element. Nostrils on the ventral surface of the snout. Two dorsal fins and an

  in front and the frontals behind to form a continuous rostral shield. Infra-dentary bones may be
  present. A series of lateral jugular plates often present in addition to the pair of principal
  plates. The Osteolepida first make their appearance in the Old Red Sandstone and Devonian

  <p><i>P. bichir</i> haunts the deeper holes and depressions of the muddy bed of the Nile, although
  it is "not essentially a bottom-liver or a mud-fish." It is most active at night when in search of
  food, and then it may readily be taken by trawl lines. The lobate pectoral fins are used for
  progression, but their primary function is to act as balancers, and they exhibit the
  characteristic trembling movements so often seen in the balancing fins of Teleosts.
  <i>Polypterus</i> does not readily live out of water, rarely longer than three to four hours, and
  then only when covered with damp grass or weeds. <i>P. bichir</i> is said to feed on small
  Teleosts, which it swallows whole, and to these there may be added in other species, Batrachians
  and Crustaceans. The observations of Budgett show that in captivity <i>Polypterus</i> often
  remains motionless for a long time at the bottom of the water, the anterior part of the body
  resting upon the tips of the <span class="pagenum" id="page483"><span
  class="smaller">{483}</span></span>pectoral fins. According to the same observer, the air-bladder
  is an accessory respiratory organ, supplementary to the gills, rather than a hydrostatic
  organ.</p>

  <p>In <i>P. bichir</i> the eggs ripen from June to September, inclusive, and, as in most other
  Nile Fishes, the breeding season is during or just after the period of inundation. <i>P.
  senegalus</i> and <i>P. lapradei</i> spawn during the rainy season in the months of July, August,
  and September, but nothing is certainly known as to the place or mode of deposition of the eggs.
  During the breeding season <i>Polypterus</i> is unusually active and excitable, and at this period
  the anal fin of the male becomes greatly thickened and enlarged, and has its surface thrown into
  deep folds between the successive fin-rays.<a id="NtA_574" href="#Nt_574"><sup>[574]</sup></a> The
  use of the modified fin is not known. During his stay at McCarthy Island, about 160 miles up the
  River Gambia, Budgett<a id="NtA_575" href="#Nt_575"><sup>[575]</sup></a> was fortunate in securing
  a larva of <i>P. senegalus</i>, 1 to 1&frac14; inches in length, or only about one-third the length of
  any larval <i>Polypterus</i> previously known (Fig. 281). The larva is described as a most
  beautiful object, "marked with black stripes on a golden ground, with a conspicuous golden stripe
  on each side above the eye, across the spiracle, and along the dorsal surface of the external
  gill." The pinnate external or cutaneous gills were relatively of much greater size than in the
  considerably more advanced stage figured elsewhere,<a id="NtA_576"
  href="#Nt_576"><sup>[576]</sup></a> and reached half-way to the tail. The dorsal fin is not
  divided into finlets, and behind it is continuous with the caudal, while the anal fin is scarcely
  distinct from the <span class="pagenum" id="page484"><span
  class="smaller">{484}</span></span>lower lobe of the caudal. The fin-rays which support the
  ventral portion of the caudal fin are more numerous and longer than those in relation with the
  dorsal lobe, and hence at this stage the tail is really heterocercal.</p>

  to certain rivers of West Africa. First obtained at Creek Town on the Old Calabar river, it is now
  known to occur in the delta of the Niger, on the coast of Cameroon, and as far south as the river
  Chiloango, frequenting the smaller muddy rivers opening into the estuaries.<a id="NtA_578"

  insects and crustaceans. The anal fin is enlarged in the male, and the young are provided with
  cutaneous gills. <i>Calamichthys</i> may attain a length of nearly 40 cm.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In the remaining Teleostomi (<span class="sc">Actinopterygii</span>) the paired
  fins are invariably non-lobate, with abbreviate, multibasal endoskeletal supports. Fin-rays are
  the main support of both the median and paired fins. Jugular plates are usually replaced by
  branchiostegal rays, but both may co-exist. The Actinopterygii are the successors of the
  Crossopterygii in palaeontological sequence, and when the latter began to decline in Carboniferous
  and Permian times, the former, mainly represented by the earlier Chondrostei, had already become
  the dominant Fishes of the period.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order II. Chondrostei (Acipenseroidei).</b></p>

  <p>In these Fishes, the oldest and the most primitive of the Actinopterygii, the fin-rays of the
  median fins still continue to retain their primitive numerical superiority over the radials, and
  the tail is heterocercal. There is a single dorsal and an anal fin, which, like the upper lobe of
  the caudal fin, are generally provided with fulcra. Pelvic fins abdominal. Squamation typically
  rhombic and ganoid. Vertebral column acentrous. So far as is known the chondrocranium is but
  little ossified, and the cranial bones are mainly dermal. The secondary pectoral girdle still
  includes a pair of infra-clavicles.</p>

  <p>The Chondrostei are first represented in the Lower Devonian by the solitary Palaeoniscid genus
  <i>Cheirolepis</i>, a contemporary of the earliest Crossopterygii. They occur throughout the
  Mesozoic period, except in the Cretaceous, and also in the Eocene, and while steadily diminishing
  in number and variety they gradually approximate to their degenerate and in some respects highly
  specialised descendants, the Sturgeons and Paddle-Fishes of the existing Fish fauna. Of the seven
  families included in the group the Palaeoniscidae are the oldest and the most generalised. The
  Platysomidae are a specialised offshoot from the Palaeoniscidae, and, if they are rightly to be
  considered as Chondrostei, perhaps the same may be said of the problematic Belonorhynchidae. On
  <span class="pagenum" id="page486"><span class="smaller">{486}</span></span>the other hand, there
  are certain features in the Catopteridae which indicate an approach to Fishes of an altogether
  more modern type. Finally, the Chondrosteidae represent a stage in a career of degeneration, the
  climax of which is reached by the modern Polyodontidae and Acipenseridae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Palaeoniscidae.</b><a id="NtA_579" href="#Nt_579"><sup>[579]</sup></a>&mdash;Fishes
  with fusiform bodies, short dorsal and anal fins, and usually with a complete investment of
  articulating rhombic, rarely cycloid, ganoid scales (Fig. 283). Fulcra generally present at the
  bases of the median fins, and especially along the dorsal border of the upper caudal lobe. Ribs
  are not known to be present. Skull invested by a very complete series of paired dermal bones,
  which in number and disposition conform to the normal Teleostome type (Fig. 284). The secondary
  upper jaw includes both premaxillae and large maxillae; and, as a rule, both the dentary and

  bones is complete, including numerous branchiostegal rays. There is a single small median jugular
  plate.</p>

  <p>The Palaeoniscidae are remarkable both for their individual and specific abundance and for
  their extensive range in time. Represented only by <i>Cheirolepis</i> in the Middle Old Red
  Sandstone and Devonian, the family attained its maximum development in the later Palaeozoic rocks
  (Carboniferous and Lower Permian), became rare in the Mesozoic, finally dwindling away at the
  close of the Jurassic period. Their geographical distribution in the past is hardly less
  remarkable. In various geological formations they have been found in Great Britain and Ireland, in
  widely remote parts of continental Europe, and in North America, South Africa, and Australia.
  <i>Cheirolepis</i>, <i>Amblypterus</i>, <i>Canobius</i>, <i>Phanerosteon</i>, <i>Elonichthys</i>,
  <i>Cryphiolepis</i>, <i>Palaeoniscus</i>, and <i>Trissolepis</i> are Palaeozoic genera.

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Catopteridae.</b>&mdash;It is very probable that this widely-distributed Triassic
  family is an offshoot from the Palaeoniscidae. It agrees with the latter in the general character
  of the head and pectoral girdle and in the rhombic squamation, but differs from its progenitors
  and approaches the more modern Holostei in the semi-heterocercal condition of the tail, and in the

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Chondrosteidae.</b>&mdash;This family affords an interesting annectant link between
  the Palaeoniscidae and their degenerate living representatives the Polyodontidae and
  Acipenseridae. They agree with the latter in the general shape of the body, the growth of a
  preoral rostrum, and in the relatively small size of their ventrally-placed and probably
  protrusible mouth (Fig. 287). The skin is entirely scaleless, except on the upper lobe of the

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>On the other hand, their relationship to the Palaeoniscidae is indicated by the general
  disposition of the dermal bones of the cranial roof, and the presence of a transverse row of
  supra-temporals and of an extensive series of branchiostegal rays (Fig. 288). The family is
  represented by <i>Chondrosteus</i><a id="NtA_582" href="#Nt_582"><sup>[582]</sup></a> from the
  Lower Lias of Dorset and Leicestershire, and <i>Gyrosteus</i> from the Upper Lias of Yorkshire.
  From an evolutionary point of view it is significant that the Chondrosteidae do not make their
  appearance until the Palaeoniscidae are approaching extinction.</p>

  <p>The two remaining families, the Polyodontidae and the Acipenseridae, agree in presenting a
  remarkable leaven of characters otherwise distinctive of the typical Elasmobranch, associated with
  certain primitive features which they have doubtless inherited from some remote ancestral stock
  common both to existing Elasmobranchs and to the other primary groups of Fishes, and also with
  others obviously due to degeneration.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The most interesting illustration of the first point is to be found in the condition of the
  primitive upper jaw which, especially in the Polyodontidae, is typically Elasmobranch in the
  median union of the palato-quadrate bars beneath the basis cranii, but Teleostome in the presence
  of a secondary upper jaw formed by two maxillae. Both families also agree in possessing an
  acentrous vertebral column which, if it does so far resemble that of Teleostomes in being
  potentially arco-centrous, nevertheless has a better developed series of distinct inter-dorsal and
  inter-ventral cartilages, regularly alternating with only partially bony basi-dorsals and
  basi-ventrals, than is to be met with in any other adult Fishes except Elasmobranchs. Primitive
  features are apparent in the presence of spiracles, sometimes associated with pseudobranchs; the
  presence in one family (Acipenseridae) of a hyoidean hemibranch supplied with blood directly from
  the ventral aorta, and the existence of a multi-valvular conus arteriosus and an intestinal spiral
  valve. Finally, the massive growth of the chondrocranium wholly devoid of cartilage bones, except
  in so far as they may be represented by splint-like membrane bones, the fragmentation of the
  investing dermal bones, the degeneration of the opercular skeleton and the loss of branchiostegal
  rays, and the almost complete disappearance of the primitive rhombic squamation, are probably to
  be regarded <span class="pagenum" id="page491"><span class="smaller">{491}</span></span>as the
  outcome of a long-continued career of degeneration from some remote Palaeoniscid ancestor.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Polyodontidae.</b>&mdash;The Polyodontidae are more generalised, and in some
  features decidedly more Selachioid than the Acipenseridae. Body fusiform and apparently scaleless,
  but the primitive squamation is still represented by isolated vestigial scales imbedded in the
  otherwise soft skin, and by a continuous series of rhombic scales on the upper caudal lobe, which
  also has a dorsal fringe of large fulcra.<a id="NtA_583" href="#Nt_583"><sup>[583]</sup></a>
  Rostrum exceptionally long, spatulate or somewhat conical, with a rigid axis and thinner and more
  flexible margins. Barbels absent. Mouth wide, not spout-like. Pectoral fins devoid of spines. Two
  pairs of membrane-closed vacuities separate the paired dermal bones of the cranial roof (possibly
  parietals and frontals) from the more laterally-placed post-temporals and squamosals, and there
  are no median plates posterior to the orbits, nor any representatives of supra-temporals. A feeble
  suboperculum is retained in addition to a small rayed operculum. Hyoidean hemibranch completely
  suppressed. Two genera only are known, each with a single species.</p>

  <p>The Paddle-Fish or Spoon-Bill, <i>Polyodon folium</i> (Fig. 289) inhabits the rivers of the
  Southern States of North America, the Mississippi, Ohio, and Missouri, and their numerous
  tributary rivers and streams. A Fish of sluggish habits, <i>Polyodon</i> feeds chiefly on mud and
  the minute organisms it contains, the exceptionally long gill-rakers probably forming an efficient
  filter to prevent the food particles escaping through the gill-clefts with the expiratory water
  current. The singular rostrum is apparently used for stirring up the mud when feeding, but in view
  of the muddy waters the Fish frequents, and the very small size of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page492"><span class="smaller">{492}</span></span>the eyes, its value as a tactile organ must
  not be overlooked. <i>Polyodon</i> may attain a length of 5 to 6 feet. The time of spawning
  varies, according to locality, from March to June. Nothing is known of the development of
  <i>Polyodon</i>. Young less than 6 to 8 inches in length are unknown, and specimens of this size
  are very rarely seen. The jaws are furnished with minute teeth until the Fish is about half-grown,
  when they become edentalous. Caviare is made from the eggs, and the centres at which this industry
  is carried on are chiefly situated along the course of the Mississippi. The second species,
  <i>Psephurus gladius</i>, inhabits the Yang-tse-Kiang and Hoangho rivers of China, and differs
  from <i>Polyodon</i> in the conical shape of its rostrum and the smaller number and larger size of
  its fulcra. <i>Psephurus</i> is stated to reach a length of 20 feet. The family is represented in
  the Eocene of Wyoming by the genus <i>Crossopholis</i>, which is note-worthy for the retention of
  trunk scales in the form of small, somewhat quadrate denticulated discs, arranged in oblique
  rows.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Acipenseridae.</b>&mdash;In the Sturgeon family the body is elongate, cylindrical,
  and somewhat bulky. Rostrum well developed and often massive, with a transverse row of simple or
  branched preoral barbels on its ventral surface. Mouth small and remarkably protrusible. Jaws
  devoid of teeth except in the larvae. As in the preceding family, the primitive rhombic squamation
  is confined to the upper lobe of the tail, which, like the dorsal and anal fins, is furnished with
  fulcra. Elsewhere the scales are represented by five longitudinal rows of large bony scutes and by
  intervening small scattered ossifications. The anterior dermal ray of the pectoral fin is stout
  and spine-like. The dermal bones of the cranial roof suturally articulate with one another to form
  a continuous shield, uninterrupted by lateral vacuities. A median dermal bone in the occipital
  region transmits the occipital sensory canal. The opercular series is represented only by an
  opercular bone.</p>

  <p>The family includes but two genera, <i>Acipenser</i> (Fig. 290) and <i>Scaphirhynchus</i>, and
  about twenty species, confined to the seas, estuaries, and rivers of the temperate and north
  temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. <i>Acipenser</i> includes the more typical
  Sturgeons, and is distinguished by the presence of spiracles, and by the fact that the
  longitudinal rows of scutes remain distinct to the base of the caudal fin.</p>

  <p>There are probably about fifteen species, but the exact number is uncertain. Sturgeons are
  abundant in the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, the Caspian, and their tributary rivers, notably the
  Danube, Don, Dnieper, Ural, and Volga. They are also present in the rivers and on the coasts of
  Northern Europe and of China. Five species occur in North America, on the Atlantic and Pacific
  coasts, and in the rivers of these regions as well as in the Great Lakes.<a id="NtA_584"
  href="#Nt_584"><sup>[584]</sup></a> One or two species are almost exclusively fresh-water, but
  most Sturgeons are migratory Fishes, living in the sea, but ascending rivers for spawning. Their
  food consists of worms, molluscs, the smaller Fishes and aquatic plants; and in feeding the mouth
  is protruded downwards in the form of a cylindrical, spout-like structure and thrust into the mud.
  The only species certainly known to frequent the British coasts is the common Sturgeon (<i>A.
  sturio</i>), which is also found in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, and is abundant on the
  Atlantic coast of North America from Maine to South Carolina. The species occurs all round our
  coasts, more plentifully, perhaps, on the northern and eastern shores. In the spring and summer
  the Fish ascends the rivers, often to a considerable distance. Its presence has been recorded in
  the Severn, near Shrewsbury; in the Trent at Nottingham, and also, but not in recent years, in the
  Thames above London Bridge.<a id="NtA_585" href="#Nt_585"><sup>[585]</sup></a> In this country the
  species is a "Royal Fish," and by an unrepealed Act of Edward II. it is enacted that "the King

  capture of individuals 8 to 10 feet in length has been recorded. The great Russian Sturgeon (<i>A.
  huso</i>), which is common in the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov and the Caspian, and in the rivers
  flowing into them, is the largest of all the Sturgeons, individuals weighing 2760 and 3200 pounds
  having been captured. The Sterlet (<i>A. ruthenus</i>), similarly distributed and often ascending
  the Danube to Vienna, is much smaller, rarely exceeding a length of three feet.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In Europe <i>A. sturio</i> spawns about July, but in North America (Delaware river) during May.
  Small in size, the eggs are produced in enormous numbers, a single female, it is said, producing
  about 3,000,000 in one season. They are invested by a gelatinous sheath, so that they readily
  stick to one another or to other objects, and, when deposited, they adhere in streaks or
  sheet-like masses to the bed of the river. The young are hatched very early, about the third or
  fourth day in <i>A. sturio</i>, and in the Sterlet between the ninth and twelfth, the length of
  the larva then varying from 7 to 10 mm. When they are a few days old the larvae closely resemble
  those of existing Holostei except that the small opercular folds leave the gills freely exposed
  (Fig. 291). A shallow pigmented groove in front of the mouth apparently represents the sucker of
  the young <i>Amia</i> and <i>Lepidosteus</i>. Although toothless in the adult, both the Sturgeon
  and Sterlet possess vestigial rudimentary, uncalcified, larval teeth, which in shape resemble the
  teeth of a Dog-Fish, consisting of a broad base and a sharp spine.</p>

  <p>The Sturgeon is a Fish of considerable economic importance. The flesh is an article of food,
  and from the ovaries of certain Russian and American species thousands of hundredweights of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page495"><span class="smaller">{495}</span></span>caviare are prepared
  annually. Large quantities of isinglass are obtained from the air-bladders, in the United States
  and in Russia. The organ is split open and washed; the inner lining is then stripped off and the
  bladder dried as rough isinglass.</p>

  <p>The second genus, <i>Scaphirhynchus</i>, which includes the Shovel-nosed Sturgeons, differs
  from <i>Acipenser</i> in the long, flattened, and almost spatulate shape of the rostrum, the
  suppression of the spiracles, and the union of the longitudinal rows of scutes beneath the dorsal
  fin to form a scaly armature completely investing the tail. The distribution of the genus affords
  an interesting parallel to that of the Polyodontidae. Of the four species, one (<i>S.
  platyrhynchus</i>) is common in the Mississippi valley and in the rivers of the Western and
  Southern States of North America, while the remaining species, also exclusively fresh-water,
  frequent the rivers of Tartary.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Acipenserid&aelig; are not known to occur earlier than the Tertiary. Scutes, pectoral
  spines and fragmentary bones, indistinguishable from the corresponding parts of existing species,
  have been recorded from the London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey (Lower Eocene), and from later
  Eocene deposits in the Isle of Wight and Hampshire; and also from the Pliocene of England (Red
  Crag of Suffolk) and Virginia.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order III. Holostei (Lepidosteoidei).</b></p>

  <p>The Holostei include a large and somewhat heterogeneous assemblage of Fishes, most of which are
  now extinct. As a group they are by no means easy to define or delimit. Widely separated from the
  Chondrostei, there is little evidence of the existence of connecting links between the two groups,
  although in some respects the Catopteridae may be regarded as transitional. On the other side,
  however, the Holostei shade off almost imperceptibly into the Malacopterygian Teleostei. In
  different fossil and recent Holostei there may be traced the gradual acquisition of the more
  special Teleostean characters and the elimination of the more archaic features of their remote
  Teleostome ancestors; and in a general sense this may be taken as the key to the more salient
  attributes of the group. It is not suggested that all the families of Holostei are on the direct
  lines of Teleostean descent. Some families, like the Eugnathidae and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page496"><span class="smaller">{496}</span></span>Amiidae, may possibly occupy this position,
  but others, such as the Pycnodonts, for example, seem to be highly specialised and terminal
  offshoots which have left no descendants. Of the more generalised features which different
  Holostei retain, mention may be made of the prevalence of rhombic scales which, like the dermal
  cranial bones, are generally invested by a variously ornamented coat of ganoin; the presence of
  fulcra, cheek-plates, post- or sub-orbital ossicles, and of a complex lower jaw, which includes
  dentigerous splenials; and the abdominal position of the pelvic fins. On the other hand,
  indication of advancing specialisation in the Teleostean direction are to be noted in the
  numerical agreement between the dermal fin-rays of the median fins and their supporting radialia,
  and in the character of the vertebral column. Some Holostei, especially the earlier forms, are
  acentrous, but between this primitive condition and the possession of well-ossified centra,
  associated with equally bony arcualia, almost every gradation is to be found. The chondrocranium
  is more or less completely replaced by cartilage bones corresponding to those generally present in
  Teleosts, while the palato-pterygoid cartilages, likewise modified by the growth of cartilage
  bones, separately articulate with the lateral ethmoid regions instead of meeting in a ventral
  symphysis beneath the basis cranii. With rare exceptions (<i>e.g.</i> certain Pycnodonts) the
  opercular skeleton is complete, and includes branchiostegal rays; and although a single gular
  plate is often present, it may be absent in entire families. Like so many other structures, the
  tail is in a transitional state: really heterocercal, but incipiently homocercal, it may be
  described as semi-heterocercal. Infra-clavicular plates no longer form part of the secondary
  pectoral girdle, their place being taken by cleithra which, as in most Teleosts, meet in a ventral
  symphysis.</p>

  <p>Indications of transition are not wanting in the squamation in certain families, and may be
  seen in the partial or complete replacement of the rhombic type by thin, imbricated, cycloid
  scales. Lastly, the soft parts of the two surviving genera are not without features of similar
  significance. A multivalvular conus arteriosus, it is true, is still retained, but the spiral
  valve is vestigial, the spiracles are closed, and in the female of one genus (<i>Lepidosteus</i>)
  the gonoducts are peritoneal tubes, continuous, as in most Teleosts, with the investments of the
  ovaries.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page497"><span class="smaller">{497}</span></span></div>

  <p>The Fishes here included in the Holostei constitute the Protospondyli and Aetheospondyli of
  Smith Woodward.<a id="NtA_587" href="#Nt_587"><sup>[587]</sup></a> In the former group vertebral
  centra are either entirely absent, or, if present, their components in the form of alternating
  hypo- and pleuro-centra invariably remain distinct in the tail. The latter group has been
  instituted for the provisional reception of two highly specialised families of uncertain
  relationships, which differ from the Protospondyli in their higher grade of vertebral structure,
  the centra always being complete without any indication of distinct hypo- and pleuro-centra.</p>

  <p>The Holostei first appear in the Permian, where they are represented by a single genus
  (<i>Acentrophorus</i>). During the Mesozoic period they were abundant in the Trias, reaching their
  maximum development and becoming the dominant Fishes of the period in the Jurassic. In the
  Cretaceous they began to decline, and in the Tertiaries became reduced to the two families which
  at the present day are the sole survivors of the group.</p>

  <p>Of the six families of Protospondyli the Semionotidae are the oldest and most generalised, and
  the Macrosemiidae a closely allied group. The Pycnodontidae are a highly specialised and terminal
  offshoot. The Eugnathidae obviously lead to the Amiidae, and from the same stock it is probable
  that the Pachycormidae have been derived. The relations of the Aspidorhynchidae and Lepidosteidae
  (Aetheospondyli) are extremely doubtful. That the two families are allied seems probable, but
  beyond the possibility of a remote connection with the Protospondyli there is no clue to their
  ancestry.</p>

  present on the premaxillae, maxillae, palatines and dentaries, and smaller teeth on the vomers,

  <span class="pagenum" id="page500"><span class="smaller">{500}</span></span>Erie. It is a
  voracious, carnivorous Fish, preying upon other Fish as well as upon fresh-water Crustaceans and
  Insects, very tenacious of life, and of no economic value. The male is smaller than the female,
  about 18 inches in length, and is distinguished by the presence of a round black spot, encircled

  <p><i>Amia</i> frequently rises to the surface, especially when the water is foul, and takes in
  large mouthfuls of air, and it is probable that the air is subsequently passed into the spacious
  cellular air-bladder which acts as a lung. The breeding season, during which the coloration of the
  Fish is more brilliant than at other times, lasts from the beginning of May to June, but it may
  begin and end somewhat earlier if the temperature be favourable. The Fish makes its way from the
  deeper water, where it has remained sluggish during the winter, to the spawning ground. This is
  usually at the swampy end of a lake where there is an abundance of aquatic herbage intersected by
  channels of clear water. There the Fish is said to circle round until the soft weeds and rootlets
  are bent and crushed aside, so as to leave an area having the appearance of a crude form of
  nest,<a id="NtA_588" href="#Nt_588"><sup>[588]</sup></a> in which the eggs are deposited. They may
  be found in enormous numbers adhering to the leaves and rootlets of the weedy home. After
  oviposition the male remains on guard until the young are hatched out, when they appear to leave
  the nest in a body, still under the protection of their watchful parent. At all events a little
  later the male has been observed to be accompanied by a swarm of young fry, which he keeps
  together by circling round them. The development of the eggs is remarkably rapid. From the first
  cleavage of the egg to the hatching of the embryo the whole <span class="pagenum"
  id="page501"><span class="smaller">{501}</span></span>process may be completed within from 4 to 8
  days. When hatched the larvae are about 5 to 6 mm. long. They possess a large yolk sac and a
  preoral sucker for attachment. The pectoral fins are conspicuous structures before there is any
  trace of the pelvic fins.</p>

  <p><i>Lepidosteus</i> is a voracious Fish, preying upon smaller Fishes, and, except in the
  breeding season, it frequents the deeper parts of the rivers or lakes. The Fish is constantly in
  the habit of rising to the surface and emitting bubbles of gas, either through the mouth or by the
  branchial clefts, and it is probable that this gas is air which has been previously swallowed at
  the surface and passed into the air-bladder. About May <i>Lepidosteus</i> resorts in large numbers
  to shallower water, where the temperature is <span class="pagenum" id="page504"><span
  class="smaller">{504}</span></span>higher, for the purpose of spawning, each female being attended
  by from one to four males.<a id="NtA_592" href="#Nt_592"><sup>[592]</sup></a> During brief
  recurring periods of excitement, accompanied by convulsive lashing movements, the eggs and sperm
  are emitted. The eggs are extremely sticky, and adhere tenaciously to the rocks and stones on
  which they are deposited. In a few days the embryos hatch out, and at this stage the larva has a
  huge mouth surmounted by a terminal preoral disc, fringed with a row of marginal wart-like suckers
  (Fig. 300). The yolk sac is so large as greatly to hamper the movements of the larva; hence, by
  means of its suckers, the young <i>Lepidosteus</i> attaches itself to surrounding objects, and
  remains almost entirely motionless for some little time after hatching. Later, about a fortnight
  after escaping from the egg, the yolk becomes completely absorbed, the suckers degenerate and
  eventually disappear, and the larva, freed from its load of nutritive reserve, assumes a more
  active life. After the absorption of the yolk the larvae of Mosquitos appears to form the
  exclusive diet of the young <i>Lepidosteus</i> for some time, but very soon young Fishes are
  readily devoured.<a id="NtA_593" href="#Nt_593"><sup>[593]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Class III. Dipneusti (Dipnoi).</b></p>

  <p>These singularly interesting Fishes are distinguished by their more or less acutely lobate
  paired fins and their overlapping cycloid scales, and by the fact that the bony dermal fin-rays of
  the median fins are much more numerous than their supporting radialia. Tail heterocercal or
  apparently diphycercal. Nostrils inferior. Vertebral column acentrous. The radialia of the median
  fins articulate with the contiguous neural or haemal spines and agree with them numerically. Skull
  autostylic. Premaxillae and maxillae absent, but a secondary lower jaw is represented by certain
  dermal bones of which tooth-bearing splenials are the most important, the dentary bones being
  absent altogether, or, if present, toothless and small. The cranial dermal bones include median as
  well as paired lateral plates, but their relations to those of other Fishes are very obscure. Two
  opercular bones are always present, but branchiostegal rays are unknown. One of the most important
  diagnostic features is the dentition. All Dipneusti agree in possessing large tritoral dental
  plates supported by the palato-pterygoid and splenial bones. The secondary pectoral girdle
  includes only cleithra and infraclavicles (clavicles). There is a pelvic girdle. Claspers absent.
  Of the four families of Dipneusti, two, the Ctenodontidae and the Uronemidae, are exclusively
  Palaeozoic. The third, the Ceratodontidae, is Mesozoic, and still survives. The fourth, the
  Lepidosirenidae, is known only by two existing genera.</p>

  <p>The two remaining families possess certain features which cannot be affirmed to have existed in

  concerned, unique modifications of the air-bladder and vascular system, and the olfactory
  organs,<a id="NtA_598" href="#Nt_598"><sup>[598]</sup></a> which are more or less closely
  associated with air-breathing habits and indicate a marked convergence towards the Amphibia. Side
  by side with such indications of advancing specialisation in certain directions, ample evidence of
  a remote ancestry is to be seen in such primitive features as the presence of a spiral valve and a
  multi-valvular conus arteriosus, and in the short and simple alimentary canal. Of other points of
  agreement mention may be made of the absence of jugular plates, the presence of vomerine teeth,
  the continuity of all the median fins, and the apparently diphycercal but probably gephyrocercal
  character of the tail.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Ceratodontidae.</b>&mdash;Body elongated and compressed. Scales large, thin,
  non-ganoid, and partially enclosed in dermal pouches. Paired fins biserial. Chondrocranium
  complete. Dermal bones wholly devoid of ganoin, reduced in number but increased in size.
  Circumorbital bones present. Dental plates oval, crescentic or triangular, traversed by several
  radiating enamelled ridges, terminating in smooth or feebly denticulated biting margins. Lower jaw
  with a small toothless dentary on each side. The hyoid arch includes a small hyomandibular and a
  hypo-hyal in addition to a cerato-hyal. Branchial arches five in number and bisegmented. The gills
  exhibit little evidence of <span class="pagenum" id="page508"><span
  class="smaller">{508}</span></span>degeneration. Hyo-branchial cleft open, and associated with a
  pseudobranch. The first four branchial arches carry holobranchs. Air-bladder single. Young not
  provided with cutaneous gills. Two genera only are known, the Mesozoic <i>Ceratodus</i> and the
  still living <i>Neoceratodus</i>. The former genus includes numerous species, for the most part
  known only by their dental plates, and has a remarkably wide distribution in different geological
  formations. Species occur in the Trias of England, Germany, India, South Africa (Upper Karoo
  strata), and also, but more rarely, in certain Jurassic deposits in England and in Colorado.<a
  id="NtA_599" href="#Nt_599"><sup>[599]</sup></a> <i>Neoceratodus</i> is represented by a solitary
  species, <i>N. forsteri</i><a id="NtA_600" href="#Nt_600"><sup>[600]</sup></a> (Fig. 304, A),
  which is now restricted to the Burnett and Mary rivers in Queensland. A somewhat wider
  distribution of the species in recent times is indicated by the presence of teeth in the later
  Tertiary (alluvial) deposits of Darling Downs, near the borders of New South Wales.</p>

  <p>The <i>Neoceratodus</i><a id="NtA_601" href="#Nt_601"><sup>[601]</sup></a> of the Burnett
  frequents the comparatively stagnant pools or water-holes which alternate with shallow runs and
  are usually full of water all the year round. In these pools, filled with a rich growth of aquatic
  vegetation, and often the favourite haunt of the Platypus (<i>Ornithorhynchus</i>), the Fish is
  fairly abundant. Inactive and sluggish in its habits, usually lying motionless on the bottom, the
  Fish is easily captured by the natives with hand-nets or baited hooks. <i>Neoceratodus</i> lives
  on fresh-water Crustaceans, worms, and molluscs, and to obtain them it crops the luxuriant
  vegetation of the water-holes much in the same way that a Polychaet or a Holothurian swallows sand
  for the sake of the included nutrient particles. Apparently the air-bladder is a functional lung
  at all times, acting in conjunction with the gills. At irregular intervals the Fish rises to the
  surface and protrudes its snout in order to empty its lung and take in fresh air. While doing so
  the animal makes a peculiar grunting noise, "spouting" as the local fishermen call it, which may
  be heard at night for some distance, and is probably caused by the forcible expulsion of air
  through the mouth. Useful as the lung is as a breathing organ under normal conditions, there can
  be little doubt that its value as such is much greater whenever gill-breathing becomes difficult
  or impossible.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This seems to be the case during the hot season, when the water becomes foul from the presence
  of decomposing animal or vegetable matter. Semon records a striking illustration of this in the
  case of a partially dried-up water-hole, in which the water had become so foul that it was full of
  dead fishes of various kinds. Fatal as these conditions were to ordinary Fishes,
  <i>Neoceratodus</i> not only survived but seemed to be quite healthy and fresh. Such observations
  are of exceptional interest. Not only do they afford a clue to the conditions of life which, in
  the course of time, probably led to lung-breathing in <i>Neoceratodus</i>, but they also suggest
  the possibility that a similar environment has been conducive to the evolution of air-breathing
  Vertebrates from gill-breathing and Fish-like progenitors. In spite of its pulmonary respiration,
  <i>Neoceratodus</i> more closely resembles the typical Fishes in its habits than any other
  Dipneusti. It lives all the year round in the water. There is no evidence that it ever becomes
  dried up in the mud, or passes into a summer sleep in a cocoon, and the well-developed condition
  of its gills suggest that these organs play a more important r&ocirc;le in breathing than in either
  <i>Protopterus</i> or <i>Lepidosiren</i>. The Fish is not known to leave the water, and the paired
  fins, useful no doubt as paddles, are quite incapable of supporting the bulky body on terra firma.
  In fact, when <i>Neoceratodus</i> is taken out of its natural element it seems to be more helpless
  than most other Fishes, and, in spite of its capacity for lung-breathing, soon dies unless kept
  moist by artificial means. Spawning takes place from April to November, principally in September
  and October. The eggs, invested by a jelly-like coat, secreted by the oviducal walls, are
  deposited <span class="pagenum" id="page511"><span class="smaller">{511}</span></span>not in a
  nest, but singly amongst aquatic vegetation, and, as they are not adherent, it is probable that
  they finally rest on the mud. The early developmental stages exhibit a general resemblance to
  those of Amphibia. There is no larval metamorphosis, and at no period does the young
  <i>Neoceratodus</i> (Fig. 305) possess cutaneous gills or a cement organ. The tail is apparently
  diphycercal from the first, and the pelvic limbs do not appear until about six weeks after the
  pectoral members. It is interesting to note that the dental plates are first represented by lines
  or patches of separate denticles (non-ctenodont), which subsequently fuse basally (ctenodont)
  before the adult condition is reached.<a id="NtA_602" href="#Nt_602"><sup>[602]</sup></a>
  <i>Neoceratodus</i> is stated to grow to a length of 5 to 6 feet.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Lepidosirenidae.</b>&mdash;Body elongate, cylindrical and more or less Eel-like,
  with small cycloid scales completely enclosed in the skin. Paired fins so acutely lobate as to
  present the appearance of tapering cylindrical filaments, equally devoid of scales and fin-rays.
  In a general way the cranial dermal bones correspond with those of <i>Neoceratodus</i>, but the
  place of the posterior median bone is taken by a large, gable-like fronto-parietal bone, situated
  internal to the head muscles, and in direct relation with the chondrocranium, which is largely
  aborted in the interorbital region. Circumorbital bones absent. Opercular bones much reduced.
  Lower jaw without dentary plates. Palatine and splenial dental plates with three non-denticulate,
  trenchant ridges. Hyoid arch consists of cerato-hyals only. Hyoidean cleft closed. Certain of the
  anterior branchial arches devoid of branchial filaments; when present the latter are leaf-like and
  free. Air-bladder a double lung. There is a larval metamorphosis, and the young possess cutaneous
  gills. The family includes two genera, <i>Protopterus</i> and <i>Lepidosiren</i>. In the former
  genus the paired fins are either uniserial or they consist of axial mesomeres only; there are six
  branchial arches and five clefts; and the larval gills are usually retained as vestiges throughout
  life. In <i>Lepidosiren</i> the paired fins are reduced to the segmented axis, without pre- or
  post-axial radials. There are five branchial arches and four clefts, and the cutaneous gills
  disappear soon after the larval metamorphosis.</p>

  <p><i>Protopterus</i> has a wide distribution over the middle portion of the great African
  continent, ranging from the river Senegal and the White Nile on the north to the Congo basin, Lake
  Tanganyika, and the Zambesi on the south. Three species are known, <i>P. annectens</i> (Fig. 304),
  <i>P. aethiopicus</i>, and <i>P. dolloi</i>. <i>Protopterus</i><a id="NtA_603"
  href="#Nt_603"><sup>[603]</sup></a> is usually found in marshes in the vicinity of rivers.
  Voracious in its habits the Fish is mainly carnivorous, subsisting principally on Frogs, worms,
  insects, and crustaceans. It is by no means averse to preying upon its own kind, and if several of
  these Fishes are confined in the same aquarium they are apt to give free vent to their cannibal
  instincts by biting off the tails or limbs of their fellows. The missing parts are soon
  regenerated, but the new members are usually somewhat abnormal, the tail, for instance, never
  regaining its original length, while a new pectoral limb may be bifid or even trifid.<a
  id="NtA_604" href="#Nt_604"><sup>[604]</sup></a> The tail is the principal organ of locomotion,
  and by its means the Fish is capable of remarkably quick, agile movements. When slowly moving over
  the bottom of an aquarium the paired limbs are observed to move to and fro on opposite sides
  alternately in a somewhat bipedal fashion. The limbs are useless for swimming, although it is
  possible that they may be helpful in creeping over the bottom, or in balancing, or as tactile
  organs. <i>Protopterus</i> is said to breathe by its lungs as well as by its gills, and to rise to
  the surface at short intervals to take in fresh air.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the dry seasons the marshes in which <i>Protopterus</i> lives become dried up, and to meet
  this adverse change in its surroundings the Fish hibernates, or passes into a summer sleep, until
  the next rainy season brings about conditions more favourable to active life. Preparatory to this
  summer sleep, and before the ground becomes too hard, the Fish makes its way into the mud to a
  depth of about 18 inches, and there coils itself up in a flask-like enlargement (Fig. 307) at the
  bottom of the burrow, which is lined by a capsule of hardened mucus secreted by the glands of the
  skin.<a id="NtA_605" href="#Nt_605"><sup>[605]</sup></a> The mouth of the flask is closed by the
  capsular wall or lid, which is perforated by a small aperture. The margins of this aperture are
  pushed inwards, so as to form a tubular funnel for insertion between the lips of the Fish. While
  encapsuled in its cocoon the Fish is surrounded by a soft slimy mucus, no doubt for the purpose of
  keeping the skin moist, and its lungs are the sole breathing organs, the air passing from the open
  mouth of the burrow through the hole in the lid directly to the mouth of the animal. The nutrition
  of the dormant Fish is effected by the absorption of the fat stored up about the kidneys and
  gonads, somewhat after a fashion not unknown in the fat-bodies of Insects and the hibernating
  glands of Rodents. Even portions of the caudal muscles undergo fatty degeneration, and thus, in a
  way which recalls the mode of nutrition of the Salmon during the breeding season, and of the
  Tadpole during its metamorphosis, a further store of nutritive material becomes available for the
  sustenance of the Fish during <span class="pagenum" id="page514"><span
  class="smaller">{514}</span></span>its long summer nap. It is highly probable that the
  exceptionally numerous leucocytes act as carriers in the work of transporting the fatty particles
  to the different organs and tissues of the body. The length of the summer sleep naturally varies
  with the duration of the dry season, and probably it lasts on an average nearly half the year
  (August to December). The cocoons, imbedded in an outward casing of hardened mud, have often been
  brought to Europe, and when placed in water of suitable temperature the long torpid
  <i>Protopterus</i> escapes from its prison in a perfectly healthy condition, and resumes its
  partly branchial and partly pulmonary mode of breathing. The negroes of the West Coast of Africa
  are very partial to these Fishes, which they dig out of the dried marshes and preserve in their
  clumps of mud for food. With the advent of the rainy season, when the marshes become flooded, the
  <i>Protopterus</i> emerges from its cocoon, and returning to its former active life, soon enters
  upon the task of reproducing its kind. The important observations of Budgett<a id="NtA_606"
  href="#Nt_606"><sup>[606]</sup></a> have thrown much light on the curious breeding habits and
  development of these Fishes. The Fish makes a nest near the edge of a swamp. The nest is simply a
  hole of irregular shape, about a foot in depth, filled with water and surrounded by long grass
  (Fig. 308). There is no lining to the nest, and the eggs are deposited on the bare mud. Until the
  eggs are hatched, which occurs about the eighth day, and while the larvae are in the nest, the
  male remains on guard, and is apt to bite severely an incautious intruder. Probably with the view
  of aerating the eggs the water is continually lashed about by the tail of the guardian parent. The
  male has no trace of the peculiar vascular filaments which adorn the pelvic limbs of the male
  <i>Lepidosiren</i> during the breeding season. The early developmental stages are similar in their
  main outlines to those of <i>Neoceratodus</i>, but the young are very different. When the young
  <i>Protopterus</i> (Fig. 309) is hatched it is provided with a crescentic glandular sucker or
  cement-organ, situated on the under side of the head behind the mouth, by means of which the larva
  attaches itself to the sides of the nest, or of the vessel in which it is confined, much in the
  same way as the young <i>Lepidosteus</i>, and probably for the same reason. It may be remarked
  that the sucker agrees in structure, position, and function with that found in Amphibian tadpoles,
  but it differs both in position and structure from its preoral analogue in the young of
  <i>Acipenser</i>, <i>Amia</i>, and <i>Lepidosteus</i>.</p>

  <p>A month-old larva has much the aspect of a larval Newt. It has four pairs of vascular plumose
  cutaneous gills (Fig. 309), which are retained as vestiges for a long time or even throughout
  life, and two pairs of synchronously-developed limbs. As an interesting instance of a nocturnal
  and protective change of colour, it may be mentioned that the dark chromatophores of the skin of
  the larva expand in the day-time and the young Fish becomes darker in colour, and therefore less
  conspicuous when seen against a background of black mud or soil. At night the contraction of the
  colour-sacs renders the larva more transparent and probably less easily <span class="pagenum"
  id="page516"><span class="smaller">{516}</span></span>visible than if opaque. The commencement of
  pulmonary respiration is coincident with the degeneration of the cutaneous gills, which takes
  place about seven weeks after the deposition of the eggs, and about a month after the larvae leave
  the nest. <i>Protopterus</i> is said to attain a length of six feet.</p>

  <p><i>Lepidosiren paradoxa</i>,<a id="NtA_607" href="#Nt_607"><sup>[607]</sup></a> probably the
  only species of the genus, is confined to South America. It occurs along the course of the main
  Amazon river, entering some of its larger affluents, such as the Ucayale, the Madeira, the Rio
  Negro, and the Tapaj&oacute;z, and also in the Chaco Boreal to the west of the Upper Paraguay river. The
  home of the <i>Lepidosiren</i> (or "Lolach," as the natives call the Fish) of the Chaco country is
  to be found in the wide-spreading marshes and swamps, which for a great part of the year are
  almost choked by a luxuriant growth of their own peculiar vegetation and covered by a floating
  carpet of surface weeds, with here and there deeper and clearer water and slow-flowing streams. In
  the dry season the water gradually shrinks and the swamps eventually become dried up. Of sluggish
  habits, the Fish wriggles slowly about at the bottom of the swamp like an Eel, using its hind
  limbs in an irregular bipedal fashion as it wends its way through the dense network of subaqueous
  plants. <i>Lepidosiren</i> is not exclusively carnivorous. The large fresh-water snail,
  <i>Ampullaria</i>, which lives in the swamps in enormous numbers, seems to be its favourite food;
  but masses of confervoid Algae are also eaten, and in its earlier stages it is probable that the
  Fish is more herbivorous than carnivorous. The Jacare (<i>Caiman sclerops</i>) feeds on
  <i>Lepidosiren</i>, and this fact, and probably also the cannibal habits of the Fish itself, may
  explain the capture of specimens with mutilated tails and regenerated, branched, pectoral limbs.
  Like other living Dipneusti, <i>Lepidosiren</i> rises to the surface to breathe. The intervals
  are, however, very variable, and no doubt depend on the relative purity or impurity of the water.
  Both expiration and inspiration are said to take place through the mouth. The snout is protruded
  on the surface, and the creature expires. After being withdrawn for a moment the head is again
  projected, and inspiration takes place through the partially open lips.</p>

  <p>When the Fish finally sinks a few bubbles of surplus air escape through the gill-clefts. A
  nocturnal and protective change of colour, similar to that described in <i>Protopterus</i>, has
  been observed, and although most strikingly manifest in the larvae, it also occurs in individuals
  of older growth. The flesh is much esteemed as food by the Indians, who wade into the swamps and
  transfix the Fishes with spears. During the rainy season the <i>Lepidosiren</i> eats voraciously,
  and a reserve of fat is stored up in the tissues. Like its African relative, the Fish ceases to
  feed on the approach of the dry season, and eventually hibernates at the dilated extremity of a
  deep tubular burrow, the entrance to which is plugged by a small lump of clay perforated by
  several round holes. On the rising of the water at the next rainy season the <i>Lepidosiren</i>
  pushes out the plug and soon emerges from its burrow.<a id="NtA_608"
  href="#Nt_608"><sup>[608]</sup></a> The breeding season begins soon after the escape of the Fish.
  The eggs are deposited in nests in the form of underground burrows excavated in the black peaty
  soil at the bottom of the swamp, with an entrance about 4-5 inches wide. At a depth of about a
  foot the burrow takes a horizontal course, its total length varying from 2-5 feet. After the eggs
  are laid the male remains to guard them. During the breeding season the pelvic limbs of the male
  enlarge and become covered by a rich growth of highly vascular, blood-red filaments 2-3 inches in
  length<a id="NtA_609" href="#Nt_609"><sup>[609]</sup></a> (Fig. 310). The use of these curious
  structures is uncertain, but it is not improbable that they act as accessory gills to enable the
  male to guard the eggs in the nest without being forced to resort to the surface to breathe air.
  The development is essentially similar to that of <i>Protopterus</i>. The larva (Fig. 311) has
  four pairs of cutaneous gills in relation with the first, second, third, and fourth branchial
  arches, inclusive, the first three pairs being the homologues of the cutaneous gills of the tailed
  Amphibia; and also a cement-organ <span class="pagenum" id="page518"><span
  class="smaller">{518}</span></span>which disappears shortly before the larval metamorphosis. At
  that period the circulation in the cutaneous gills becomes sluggish, and very soon these organs
  completely atrophy. About the same time the hyo-branchial cleft closes up, as in
  <i>Protopterus</i>. The young <i>Lepidosiren</i> soon begins to breathe air and to become more
  active and lively in its habits.<a id="NtA_610" href="#Nt_610"><sup>[610]</sup></a> The adult may

  <p class="sp5">The relations of the different genera of Dipneusti to one another has been
  discussed by Dollo in a remarkably suggestive paper.<a id="NtA_611"
  href="#Nt_611"><sup>[611]</sup></a> Until the publication of this treatise it was generally
  believed that the modern Dipneusti, <i>Neoceratodus</i>, <i>Protopterus</i>, and
  <i>Lepidosiren</i>, especially the first mentioned, were the most primitive and the more nearly
  related to the ancestral stock, while the older types, such as <i>Dipterus</i>, were regarded in
  the light of highly specialised offshoots. The continuity of the median fins, the apparently
  diphycercal character of the tail, and the wholly cartilaginous condition of the chondrocranium in
  the modern Dipneusti, were contrasted with the divided median fins, the heterocercal tail, and the
  more extensively ossified chondrocranium of the Palaeozoic forms, and the belief seemed
  inevitable. Dollo has shown, however, that there is good reason for the view that the evolution of
  the group has taken place in exactly the opposite direction; that, in fact, the older Dipneusti
  are the more archaic, and that their modern representatives have been derived from them by a
  sequence of retrogressive changes; or, in other words, the latter have much the same relation to
  the former as the degenerate Sturgeons and Paddle-Fishes to their Palaeozoic ancestors, the
  Palaeoniscidae. Taking <i>Dipterus</i>, the <span class="pagenum" id="page519"><span
  class="smaller">{519}</span></span>most ancient of all the known Dipneusti, as a starting-point,
  it is possible to select a series of genera which illustrate the evolution of the group both in
  structure and in palaeontological sequence.<a id="NtA_612" href="#Nt_612"><sup>[612]</sup></a> The
  series is as follows:&mdash;<i>Dipterus</i>, <i>Scaumenacia</i>, <i>Phaneropleuron</i>,
  <i>Uronemus</i>, <i>Ceratodus</i> (<i>Neoceratodus</i>), <i>Protopterus</i> and
  <i>Lepidosiren</i>. Briefly, the more important structural modifications observable in the
  transition from the older to the recent genera are (<i>a</i>) the gradual union of isolated median
  fins to form a continuous fin<a id="NtA_613" href="#Nt_613"><sup>[613]</sup></a>; (<i>b</i>) the
  substitution of a gephyrocercal tail for a heterocercal<a href="#Nt_613"><sup>[613]</sup></a>;
  (<i>c</i>) the degeneration of the squamation, the thick ganoid scales of the earlier types being
  replaced by thin, non-ganoid scales; (<i>d</i>) a reduction in the number of cranial dermal bones
  and the loss of their original ganoid investment; (<i>e</i>) the suppression of the jugular
  plates; and (<i>f</i>) a reduction in the size of the opercular bones. In the last two genera of
  the series, in which specialisation in some respects and degeneration in others have reached their
  maximum, the body no longer retains the fusiform and more typically Fish-like shape of the older
  genera, but, in accordance with Eel-like habits and mode of progression, has become more or less
  Eel-like in form.<a id="NtA_614" href="#Nt_614"><sup>[614]</sup></a> The paired fins are almost
  vestigial, while the scales, so deeply insunken in the skin as to be externally invisible, suggest
  that the modern Dipneusti are approximating to a final scaleless as well as to an ultimately
  limbless condition. As to the origin of the Dipneusti as a group, it seems reasonable to look for
  their ancestors in the early Devonian Crossopterygii with acutely lobate fins, or, with greater
  probability, to some still more primitive Crossopterygian with simple, non-rhizodont teeth,
  capable by fusion of giving rise to massive tritoral plates, and involving as a consequence the
  substitution of an autostylic for an originally hyostylic skull, and the suppression of the
  secondary upper jaw. In fact, when our knowledge of the development of the surviving Dipneusti and
  Crossopterygii is more complete, it is not improbable that the inclusion of the two series of
  Fishes in subordinate divisions of the Teleostomi will prove to be amply justified. The relations
  of the Dipneusti to the Amphibia are <span class="pagenum" id="page520"><span
  class="smaller">{520}</span></span>somewhat deceptive, and it seems improbable that the former
  group stands in the direct line of Amphibian descent. In most of their structural features not
  directly or remotely associated with air-breathing the Dipneusti are true Fishes, and the striking
  resemblances which they present to the Amphibians in the vascular system and lungs seem to be
  rather the outcome of physiological convergence, associated with adaptive and parallel
  modifications in structure, and due to the influence of a similar environment, than indicative of
  direct ancestral relations. With more reason it may be inferred that both the Dipneusti and the
  Amphibia have been derived from some primitive Crossopterygian ancestor with Elasmobranch
  tendencies, and subsequently became modified in certain respects on parallel lines.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In this chapter it is proposed to treat of certain fossil "Fishes" which, from our
  ignorance of much that is essential to a proper estimate of their true relationships, cannot at
  present be referred to any of the recognised primary groups of Fishes.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>I. Palaeospondylidae.</b></p>

  <p>The interesting little fossil, <i>Palaeospondylus gunni</i>,<a id="NtA_615"
  href="#Nt_615"><sup>[615]</sup></a> discovered in the Lower Old Red Sandstone of Caithness, and
  first described by Traquair, represents the calcified endoskeleton of an elongated fish-like
  organism about an inch, or not exceeding two inches, in length. The vertebral column consists of a
  series of broad, calcified ring-like centra, destitute of ribs, but possessing neural arches and
  spines, and in the caudal region haemal arches and spines in addition. The skull, of which only
  the ventral surface is known, has a complete basis cranii, laterally expanded behind by periotic
  capsules, and in front by what seem to be bulging olfactory capsules. Anteriorly, the skull
  terminates in a ring of calcified cirri. Behind the skull there are two singular post-occipital
  plates, one on each side of the anterior section of the vertebral column. The tail was apparently
  furnished with a fringing caudal fin, supported dorsally by the long forked, neural spines, and
  below by the much shorter haemal spines. There is no trace <span class="pagenum"
  id="page522"><span class="smaller">{522}</span></span>of limbs, limb-girdles, jaws, or branchial
  arches, nor any evidence of the existence of scales, denticles, or other exoskeletal
  structures.</p>

  <p><i>Palaeospondylus</i> has been regarded as a Cyclostome, a view which derives its principal
  support from the resemblance of the cirri-encircled orifice at the anterior end of the skull to an
  unpaired nasal or naso-pituitary aperture, and perhaps some measure of credence from such purely
  negative evidence as the apparent want of limbs, and of any structures comparable to jaws. But
  even if it be admitted that there is some reason for this view, it is certain that
  <i>Palaeospondylus</i> obtained a far higher grade of specialisation in certain respects than any
  of the existing Cyclostomata; the presence of calcified vertebral centra and neural arches is
  conclusive on this point.<a id="NtA_616" href="#Nt_616"><sup>[616]</sup></a>
  <i>Palaeospondylus</i> has also been compared with a larval Arthrodiran and with a larval

  <p class="ac"><b>II. Ostracodermi.</b></p>

  <p class="sp3">The Palaeozoic fish-like forms, which, more as a matter of convenience than as an
  expression of real kinship, it has been customary to include in this group, are amongst the
  earliest Craniates of which we have any precise knowledge. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page523"><span class="smaller">{523}</span></span>Of the three subordinate groups or "Orders"
  into which they have usually been divided hitherto, two, the Heterostraci and the Osteostraci,
  may, with some show of reason, be considered as related forms, and although they are characterised
  by much specialisation on independent lines, there is yet some evidence of connecting links
  between the two. The organisms comprising the third group, the Antiarchi, stand upon a very
  different footing, and at present it cannot be said that they are in any way related to either the
  Heterostraci or the Osteostraci, or indeed to any other Craniates whatsoever. The association of
  the Ostracodermi with the Cyclostomata, a view which has received more influential support than it
  deserves, is based on the presumed absence of jaws and paired fins. The absence of jaws, which, if
  present, were almost certainly cartilaginous, has yet to be proved, and even in the latter group
  it is by no means certain that they do not possess structures which, morphologically if not
  functionally, are veritable jaws. Nor is it quite certain that the lateral lobes of some
  Ostracodermi are neither pectoral flaps nor lateral fin-folds, to say nothing of the lateral
  appendages of the Antiarchi. And to these objections there is the further difficulty that there is
  absolutely no evidence that the Ostracodermi are monorhinal in the sense in which this term is
  applied to the Cyclostomata.<a id="NtA_618" href="#Nt_618"><sup>[618]</sup></a> On these grounds
  it would seem more in accordance with our present knowledge to regard the Ostracodermi as an
  independent group whose exact position in the system has yet to be determined, including, however,
  besides the generally accepted orders Heterostraci and Osteostraci, the recently founded
  provisional order Anaspida, but excluding the Antiarchi as a separate and distinct section; rather
  than to crystallise in a definite system of classification views which are either purely
  conjectural or wholly unjustifiable. Even with this limitation the Ostracodermi are by no means
  easy to define, especially if we include those remarkable shark-like forms from the Upper Silurian
  rocks of the south of Scotland which have been so admirably described in the recent classical
  memoirs of Dr. Traquair. As a rule, the head and the anterior part of the body are laterally
  expanded, and more or less sharply defined from the rest of the body by prominent postero-lateral
  angles. The exoskeleton, which exhibits an extraordinary variety of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page524"><span class="smaller">{524}</span></span>structure in the different families, ranges
  from a uniform covering of dermal denticles to a condition in which the denticles fuse to form
  anteriorly a highly characteristic tessellated or continuous dorsal shield, while posteriorly they
  become replaced by a nearly typical rhombic squamation. The tail is heterocercal. Paired fins of
  the ordinary piscine type are absent. In some Ostracodermi it seems probable that the gill-clefts
  opened into a common branchial chamber on each side, with a single external aperture, but in
  others they may have been ventral. The endoskeleton, jaws, dentition, and the nostrils are
  unknown.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order I. Heterostraci.</b></p>

  <p>The exoskeletal structures consist of dentine, or of a tissue resembling it, never of true
  bone. The orbits are marginal or lateral in position. With the exception of a caudal fin there are
  no median fins.</p>

  Branchial apertures unknown, but transverse markings on each side of the anterior part of
  <i>Thelodus pagei</i> may be indications of a branchial apparatus. The exoskeleton consists of a
  uniform covering of hollow pointed spines, devoid of a basal plate and open below
  (<i>Lanarkia</i>); or of minute shagreen-like tubercles (<i>Thelodus</i>). The tubercles or spines
  consist of dentine coated by ganoin. Of the only two known genera, <i>Thelodus</i> is a

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Drepanaspidae.</b>&mdash;This family<a id="NtA_620"
  href="#Nt_620"><sup>[620]</sup></a> affords an interesting transition to the more highly
  specialised and carapaced Pteraspidae. The head and anterior part of the trunk now form a broad
  oblong shield, rounded in front and abruptly marked off from the tail by conspicuous rounded
  angles. The exoskeleton is no longer uniform. In the caudal region the scattered spines or
  shagreen tubercles of the Coelolepids have become transformed into tuberculated quadrangular
  scales, which are further differentiated along the dorsal and ventral margins into ridge scales or
  fulcra; and from a similar source by a process of basal fusion a series of larger or smaller
  dermal plates are formed as components of large dorsal or ventral shields. The dorsal shield (Fig.
  314) is formed by a large central plate; the postero-lateral portions by two narrow falciform
  plates; and the anterior margin by a series of smaller rostral plates. Between the larger plates
  the shield is completed by numerous <span class="pagenum" id="page526"><span
  class="smaller">{526}</span></span>small polygonal plates. All the plates are superficially
  ornamented by small stellate tubercles. The ventral armature (Fig. 315) is similar to the dorsal.
  A large mental plate forms the hinder margin of the transverse slit-like mouth, the anterior limit
  of which is defined by the rostral plates already mentioned. Laterally may be seen a pair of small
  plates (<i>x</i>), each perforated by a small aperture, and probably indicating the position of
  some kind of sense-organ. Posteriorly there is a large median ventral plate, in relation with a
  pair of anterior and a pair of posterior ventral plates. The areas between the larger plates are
  filled in by numerous small polygonal plates. It is possible that there is a single external
  branchial aperture on each side, near the postero-lateral angle of the shield and behind the
  posterior ventro-lateral plate. The sole representative of the family is <i>Drepanaspis
  gem&uuml;ndenensis</i>, from the Lower Devonian of Gem&uuml;nden in Rhenish Prussia. Large examples of this
  fossil must have exceeded two feet in length.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Psammosteidae.</b>&mdash;To this family are referred certain dermal plates
  occurring, in a more or less fragmentary condition, in the Old Red Sandstone and Devonian
  formations of Great Britain and Russia. In their size and shape, and in their stellate tubercles,
  these have been compared to the dorsal, postero-lateral, and ventral plates of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page527"><span class="smaller">{527}</span></span><i>Drepanaspis</i>. That
  <i>Psammosteus</i> is closely allied to <i>Drepanaspis</i> seems certain, but for the present the
  two genera may be retained in separate families.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Pteraspidae.</b><a id="NtA_621" href="#Nt_621"><sup>[621]</sup></a>&mdash;Until the
  recent inclusion of the three preceding families, the Pteraspidae were the only representatives of
  the Heterostraci. In the best known genus, <i>Pteraspis</i>, there is a marked reduction in the
  number of the component plates of the carapace, and only seven can now be distinguished (Fig.
  316): (<i>a</i>) a large posterior dorsal plate, supporting behind a stout spine; (<i>b</i>) a
  conical rostral plate, covering the preorbital part of the head; (<i>c</i>) a pair of small
  marginal orbital plates, each with a small aperture, probably for the eye; (<i>d</i>) a pair of
  posterior lateral or cornual plates, each of which is perforated by a large oblique foramen,
  conjecturally an external branchial aperture; and (<i>e</i>) a large ventral plate. There is
  probably, also, a small median "parietal," or "pineal," plate, with a pit on its inner surface,
  situated between the rostral and posterior dorsal plates. Externally the plates are sculptured
  into fine ridges, which in their minute structure and their crenated free margins are suggestive
  of linear series of fused denticles. The tail appears to have been invested by imbricated rhombic
  scales. <i>Pteraspis</i> (Lower Old Red Sandstone of Scotland and England, and the Lower Devonian
  of Galicia); <i>Cyathaspis</i> (Upper Silurian and Lower Old Red Sandstone), known only by its
  dorsal and ventral shields; and <i>Holaspis</i> (Lower Old Red Sandstone of Monmouthshire, and the
  Upper Silurian of Pennsylvania), are the only genera.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order II. Osteostraci.</b></p>

  <p>While agreeing with the more specialised Heterostraci in the division of the body into an
  anterior carapaced portion and a free <span class="pagenum" id="page528"><span
  class="smaller">{528}</span></span>hinder part invested by a rhombic squamation, the Osteostraci
  are distinguished by the presence of bone as a histological component of the dermal hard parts; by
  the position of the orbits, which, instead of being marginal in position, are close together on
  the dorsal aspect of the carapace; and by the possession of a median dorsal fin.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Ateleaspidae.</b><a id="NtA_622" href="#Nt_622"><sup>[622]</sup></a>&mdash;The
  general shape of the body is much the same as in the Coelolepidae, but the exoskeleton consists of
  numerous polygonal tuberculated plates in front of the postero-lateral lobes, and of sculptured
  rhombic scales behind. A pair of crescentic markings, placed close together about the middle of
  the dorsal surface of the head, probably indicate the outer margins of orbital recesses (Fig.

  angles produced into highly characteristic cornua (Fig. 318). The shield consists of a single

  is probable that it has been formed by the basal fusion of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page529"><span class="smaller">{529}</span></span>numerous primitively distinct polygonal
  plates (Fig. 319, A). Between the orbits there is a separately calcified but fixed plate, which
  bears a hollow prominence, probably for the reception of a parietal organ. In some genera certain
  of the anterior dorsal and ventral scales of the trunk fuse into a continuous plate. Internally to
  the postero-lateral cornua the middle layer of the shield is prolonged backwards into a pair of
  singular flap-like lobes, which have been variously interpreted as corresponding to the lateral
  lobes of the Coelolepidae, to pectoral fins, or to opercula. The scales of the trunk and tail are
  rhombic and imbricated; on the sides of the body they are remarkably high and narrow.</p>

  <p>The best known genus is <i>Cephalaspis</i>. The earliest remains are found in the Ludlow

  of Scotland, and the Upper and Lower Devonian of Canada. Most of the species are of small size,
  but <i>C. magnifica</i>,<a id="NtA_624" href="#Nt_624"><sup>[624]</sup></a> from the Caithness
  Flagstones, the largest of all the Cephalaspids, has a shield 8&frac12; inches long, and 12 inches across
  the widest part. <i>Auchenaspis</i> occurs in the Ludlow Tilestones and the Ledbury Passage Beds,
  and also in the Upper Silurian of the Isle of Oesel in the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page530"><span class="smaller">{530}</span></span>Baltic. Another genus, <i>Didymaspis</i>,
  has been found in the Lower Old Red Sandstone of Ledbury.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Tremataspidae.</b>&mdash;The interorbital plate is free, and hence it is often lost
  in the fossils. Several species of <i>Tremataspis</i> occur in the Upper Silurian of the Isle of
  Oesel.</p>

  <p class="sp3">As regards the origin and mutual relationships of the different families comprising
  the Heterostraci, it has been urged with great force by Dr. Traquair<a id="NtA_625"
  href="#Nt_625"><sup>[625]</sup></a> that they constitute a natural sequence of forms, beginning
  with organisms whose Elasmobranch ancestry is extremely probable, and leading to
  highly-specialised types, which, considered by themselves, possess little to justify any
  conclusions whatever as to their origin or kinship. The Coelolepidae form the starting-point, and
  in the light of their exoskeleton of dermal denticles, their derivation from some primitive
  Elasmobranch prototype seems a reasonable inference.<a id="NtA_626"
  href="#Nt_626"><sup>[626]</sup></a> From the Coelolepids the path of specialisation through the
  Drepanaspidae and Psammosteidae to the Pteraspidae is marked (i.) by the basal concrescence of
  isolated denticles to form, first, numerous small polygonal plates, and then larger and less
  numerous plates, as the constituent elements of a characteristic dorsal shield, leaving, however,
  the denticles of the rest of the body to become converted into a rhombic squamation; (ii.) by
  modifications in the "lateral fin-lobes," which may become enclosed in the developing dermal
  armour (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Drepanaspis</i>), or cease to be recognisable (<i>e.g.</i>
  <i>Pteraspis</i>). The affinities of the Osteostraci are very obscure, and their inclusion with
  the Heterostraci in the same group (Ostracodermi) has hitherto rested mainly on such negative
  evidence as the supposed absence of paired limbs, jaws, and teeth; in fact, it has been affirmed
  that "there is absolutely no reason for regarding <i>Cephalaspis</i> as allied to <i>Pteraspis</i>
  beyond that the two genera occur in the same rocks."<a id="NtA_627"
  href="#Nt_627"><sup>[627]</sup></a> It is possible, however, that in <i>Ateleaspis</i> we have an
  annectent form, which in some measure combines the structural peculiarities of the two groups.
  That this singular genus belongs to the Osteostraci is proved by the presence of bone lacunae in
  its dermal hard parts, a conclusion which is strengthened by the apparently dorsal position of the
  orbits and the presence of a dorsal fin. On the <span class="pagenum" id="page531"><span
  class="smaller">{531}</span></span>other hand, its close resemblance to the Coelolepids in the
  general contour of its laterally-lobed body, and the probability that its mosaic and tuberculated
  head-shield has been formed by the concrescence of Coelolepid denticles, is at least significant
  of a relationship to the more primitive Heterostraci. Little can be conjectured as to the habits
  of these ancient "Fishes." The form and regional proportions of the body, which in some respects
  often remind one of organisms so diverse as a King Crab, or a Loricaroid Teleost (such as
  <i>Liposarcus</i>), are strongly suggestive of a grovelling, bottom-feeding, sluggish habit of
  life, in sharp contrast to the more active and predaceous Fishes whose appearance is coincident
  with the extinction of the Ostracodermi at the close of the Devonian period. Habits such as these
  may well be associated with much structural degeneration, even, it may be, with the loss of paired
  fins, and hence it is not altogether improbable that the Ostracodermi are outcasts from the
  Elasmobranchs, a degenerate race which has sought safety in a sequestered life and a coat of
  mail.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order III. Anaspida.</b></p>

  <p>This group has been instituted by Traquair<a id="NtA_628" href="#Nt_628"><sup>[628]</sup></a>
  for the provisional reception of two remarkable genera, which, owing to the absence of precise
  knowledge of the histology of their exoskeletal structures, cannot at present be referred either
  to the Heterostraci or the Osteostraci, and for which, as their discoverer remarks, no place can
  be found in the system unless they are admitted to the Ostracodermi.</p>

  <p>In <i>Birkenia</i> (Fig. 320) the body is invested by longitudinal rows of narrow scales
  arranged in oblique transverse rows, which are replaced on the head by much smaller, peculiarly
  disposed, spindle-shaped scutes. On the side of the hinder part of the head there is an oblique

  parallel, rod-like structures, the body appears to have been naked (Fig. 321). The two genera
  belong to the remarkable series of fossil Fishes from the Silurian rocks of Lanarkshire. Rare in
  the Ludlow series, <i>Birkenia</i> is by far the most common of the Fishes of the over-lying

  <p>The remarkable dorsal shield is divided into a small cephalic portion and a much larger hinder
  part investing the greater part of the trunk, both of which are strongly arched above and
  flattened ventrally, with a movable articulation between the two. The cephalic shield is formed by
  numerous symmetrically-disposed tuberculated plates, suturally connected with one another, and,
  like the other exoskeletal structures, containing bone lacunae (Fig. 322).<a id="NtA_631"
  href="#Nt_631"><sup>[631]</sup></a> The orbits are close together, near the middle of the dorsal
  surface, and between them there is a small median interorbital plate, with a deep pit on its inner
  surface, possibly for a parietal organ. A small lateral plate (<i>e.l.</i>), evidently free
  behind, suggests the presence of an operculum. Nothing is certainly known about the jaws or the
  nostrils. The mouth is situated just behind the anterior margin of the cephalic shield on the
  ventral surface, and in front of it there are two plates, <span class="pagenum" id="page534"><span
  class="smaller">{534}</span></span>which in <i>Bothriolepis canadensis</i> have their oral margins
  fringed by small "denticles"; it is possible that these plates represent the components of a
  secondary upper jaw. The dorsal armature of the trunk is shown in Fig. 322. Ventrally it is
  completed by a pair of anterior ventro-lateral plates and a pair of posterior ventro-lateral
  plates with a small median plate between the two pairs. Articulating with the anterior
  ventro-lateral plates by means of a complex hinge joint there is a pair of pectoral appendages of
  a kind entirely without parallel in any other vertebrated animals. Each appendage is completely
  encased by numerous suturally connected plates, and about the middle of its length there is a
  second movable joint. The appendages are hollow, and their cavities probably contained the muscles
  by which the limbs were moved, and the blood-vessels and nerves for their nutrition and
  innervation. A lateral line system of the normal type is present in <i>Pterichthys</i>, consisting
  of a lateral groove along the side of the trunk, and of supra-orbital and infra-orbital grooves,
  and post-temporal and infra-orbital commissures, on the head. The free portion of the body and the
  tail are invested by imbricated and finely tuberculated scales, which form fulcra in front of and
  behind the small dorsal fin. There are no pelvic fins. The caudal fin is heterocercal.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Asterolepidae.</b>&mdash;The best known genera are <i>Pterichthys</i> from the Lower
  Old Red Sandstone of Scotland and the Devonian of Eifel, and <i>Bothriolepis</i>, a more widely
  distributed genus which occurs in the Upper Old Red of Scotland and Shropshire, and in the Upper
  Devonian of Russia and Canada. Two other genera, <i>Asterolepis</i> and <i>Microbrachius</i>, are
  also found in the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland.<a id="NtA_632"

  <p class="sp3">Beyond an uncertain and shadowy relationship to the Ostracodermi, and perhaps some
  points of resemblance to the Arthrodira, the Antiarchi stand alone among Craniates. Nothing is
  known of their origin; no intermediate forms link them to any other groups, and the high
  specialisation they have attained is sufficient to negative any idea that they can "be credited
  with any share in the evolution of the Fishes of more recent periods."</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>IV. Arthrodira</b></p>

  <p>This group has been instituted for the reception of a number of remarkable armoured Fishes of
  uncertain relationships which flourished in Europe during the Devonian and Old Red Sandstone
  periods, and in North America from the Devonian to the Lower Carboniferous. The head (<i>e.g.</i>
  in <i>Coccosteus</i>)<a id="NtA_633" href="#Nt_633"><sup>[633]</sup></a> is invested dorsally by a
  series of median and lateral symmetrically-disposed tuberculated plates (Fig. 323). Two of the
  lateral plates are notched for the orbits, and between them there is an interorbital plate which
  either has a pit on its inner surface or is perforated by an open funnel, as in <i>Dinichthys</i>,
  possibly for a parietal or a pineal organ. Some of the bones present some analogy, to say the
  least, to certain of the dermal bones of a typical Teleostome, apparently representing such
  elements as paired parietals and frontals, a dermal mesethmoid, and toothless premaxillae and
  maxillae (Fig. 324, A). As in the Antiarchi, the anterior portion of the trunk is also armoured,
  above by a dorsal shield, formed by median and lateral plates, and below by a similarly
  constructed ventral shield (Fig. 324, B). A huge joint connects the head and trunk shields: hence
  the term Arthrodira or "joint-neck." The rest of the body is naked.</p>

  <p>Pectoral fins are unknown, but pelvic fins, each supported by a stout basal plate or

  id="page536"><span class="smaller">{536}</span></span>that there are well-developed and partially
  calcified neural and haemal arches associated with a persistent notochord. It is possible that the
  skull is autostylic. Gill-arches are not known. A pair of plates (Fig. 324, A, <i>j</i>) at the
  postero-lateral angles of the cephalic shield may perhaps be opercula. The teeth are conical.
  Those in the upper jaw are supported by two pairs of plates, probably vomers and palatines. In the
  lower jaw there are two series of teeth, one in front near the symphysis, and the other behind,
  supported by a single bone in each ramus. There is a well-developed lateral line system, indicated
  by surface markings on the head and trunk shields.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Coccosteidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Coccosteus</i> occurs in the Devonian of Europe and North
  America, and includes species of relatively small size, not exceeding half a metre in length.
  <i>C. decipiens</i>, the best known species, is a characteristic fossil in the Old Red Sandstone
  of Scotland. <i>Phlyctaenaspis</i><a id="NtA_634" href="#Nt_634"><sup>[634]</sup></a> is found in
  the Lower Devonian of Canada, England, and Poland. A larger Arthrodiran, with slender toothless
  jaws, <i>Homosteus</i>,<a id="NtA_635" href="#Nt_635"><sup>[635]</sup></a> is met with in the
  Lower Old Red Sandstone of the North of Scotland, and in the Devonian of Germany and Russia. The
  Old World Arthrodira must yield, however, to those of the New World for variety in size and shape,
  and in the character of their dentition.<a id="NtA_636" href="#Nt_636"><sup>[636]</sup></a> <span
  class="pagenum" id="page537"><span class="smaller">{537}</span></span>Some of the North American
  genera (<i>e.g. Dinichthys</i>) probably attained a length of ten feet, or even, as in
  <i>Titanichthys</i>, a much greater size. Some are fusiform in shape, but <i>Mylostoma</i> is
  flattened and Ray-like, and, judging from the dentition, their food and habits must have been
  equally varied. <i>Mylostoma</i> has tritoral plates not unlike those of <i>Neoceratodus</i> or
  <i>Chimaera</i>. In others the teeth are single, and conical or pointed; in <i>Titanichthys</i>
  the front teeth in both jaws are beak-shaped structures. It is highly probable that
  <i>Titanichthys</i>, <i>Mylostoma</i>, and perhaps other genera, are types of distinct
  families.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Arthrodira have been regarded as armoured Dipneusti, a view which is mainly
  based on their supposed autostylism and the nature of the dentition. But this autostylism has yet
  to be verified, and, if proved, the possibility that it may be a secondary feature, associated
  with the evolution of a peculiar dentition, must not be forgotten. Much more may be said for their
  claim to be regarded as a highly specialised race of primitive Teleostomi. Besides a
  well-developed lower jaw, bones comparable to the elements of a secondary upper jaw are known, and
  in a general way the disposition of the cranial roofing bones, and the arrangement of the
  endoskeletal elements of the pelvic fins, tend to conform to the normal Teleostome type. In fact,
  Dr. Traquair has expressed the opinion that the Arthrodira are Teleostomi and Actinopterygii.<a

  <p class="ac"><b>Order IV. Teleostei.</b><a id="NtA_638" href="#Nt_638"><sup>[638]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As stated above (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page495">495</a></span>), the Holostean Ganoids
  pass very gradually into the Teleosteans, the lower groups of which appear to have been directly
  derived from them. The precise definition of the Order Teleostei, as compared with the Ganoid
  Order Holostei, is a matter of some difficulty. The most important character appears to be the
  presence of an ossified supraoccipital bone.<a id="NtA_639" href="#Nt_639"><sup>[639]</sup></a>
  Remnants of primitive characters, such as ganoid scales, fulcra, rudiments of a splenial bone,
  spiral valve to the intestine, multivalvular conus arteriosus, are still found in some lower
  Teleosteans, but no longer in that combination which serves to define the preceding order.
  Although <i>Albula</i> is exceptional among all Teleosteans in having two transverse series of
  valves to the bulbus arteriosus instead of one, no Ganoid has fewer than three.</p>

  <p>The first remains of Teleosteans appear scantily in the Upper Trias, and it is not before we
  reach the Upper Cretaceous that they assume preponderance over other Teleostomes; whilst in the
  Upper Eocene they have already attained a development and variety of types comparable to their
  present condition. Out of some 12,000 well-established species of Fishes known to exist at <span
  class="pagenum" id="page542"><span class="smaller">{542}</span></span>the present day, about
  11,500 belong to this order. The classification of such an array of forms is, of course, a matter
  of great difficulty, and gives scope for much difference of opinion among those who have attempted
  to grapple with the subject. It is now recognised that the study of the skeleton affords the
  safest guide to a natural arrangement of the families and higher divisions. Much has been done in
  this line by Cope, Gill, Sagemehl, A. S. Woodward, and Jordan and his pupils; but the osteology of
  many important types still remains unknown. For some years a large number of skeletons have been
  prepared in the British Museum with the object of settling open questions, and this material has
  enabled me to draw up a scheme of classification which, whatever its defects, and however
  provisional, I feel sure is on the whole an improvement on those hitherto proposed, and especially
  on that generally in use in this country. The latter was, to a great extent, based on
  physiological principles; the present aims at being phylogenetic. In its preparation I have
  derived great benefit from the labours of the authors quoted above, but have endeavoured in every
  instance to verify their statements on a larger osteological material than appears to have been
  available to them. I have also had the advantage of the criticism, on many points, of my young
  colleague, Mr. C. Tate Regan, who has himself endeavoured to settle some important questions of
  classification.<a id="NtA_640" href="#Nt_640"><sup>[640]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Order Teleostei is divided into thirteen sub-orders, the probable relations of which are
  expressed in the following diagram<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">In the classification of G&uuml;nther, which has been generally in use in this country
  for the last thirty years, the Teleosts were divided into six principal groups, of ordinal rank:
  I. Acanthopterygii; II. Acanthopterygii Pharyngognathi; III. Anacanthini; IV. Physostomi; V.
  Lophobranchii; VI. Plectognathi. Group I. corresponds to Sub-Order 6 (part), 7 (part), 8 (part),
  10 (part), 11 and 12 of the present work; Group II. to Sub-Order 10 (part); Group III. to
  Sub-Order 9 and 10 (part); Group IV. to Sub-Order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (part), and 8 (part); Group V.
  to Sub-Order 7 (part); and Group VI. to Sub-Order 13.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order 1. Malacopterygii.</b></p>

  <p>Air-bladder, if present, communicating with the digestive tract by a duct. Opercle well
  developed. Pectoral arch suspended from the skull; mesocoracoid arch present.<a id="NtA_641"
  href="#Nt_641"><sup>[641]</sup></a> Fins without spines, the ventrals abdominal, if present.
  Anterior vertebrae distinct, without Weberian ossicles.</p>

  <p>This sub-order, which corresponds to the Isospondyli and Scyphophori of Cope and to a part of
  the Isospondyli of A. S. Woodward, embraces the most generalised of the Teleosts, and is
  intimately connected with the Ganoids by the fossil forms which are placed at the base of the
  series of families. The physostomous condition of the air-bladder, the connexion of the pectoral
  arch with the skull, the presence of the mesocoracoid arch, the backward position of the
  many-rayed ventral fins, the normal condition of the anterior vertebrae, the absence of true
  spines to the fins, and the separation of the supraoccipital bone from the frontals by the
  parietals, are primitive characters which among the Teleosts occur combined in some families of
  this suborder only. The mesocoracoid arch is retained by the Ostariophysi, which differ in the
  remarkably modified condition of the anterior vertebrae, but it disappears in all other Teleosts,
  which gradually acquire a more forward position of the ventral fins and a reduction in the number
  of their rays, develop spines in the vertical fins, and lose the communication of the air-bladder
  with the outside.</p>

  <p>The Malacopterygii may be divided into twenty-one families, the characters of which are
  contrasted in the following synopsis<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Pholidophoridae.</b>&mdash;Margin of the upper jaw formed by the praemaxillaries and
  the maxillaries, the latter large and loosely attached; teeth small and conical. Parietal bones
  separating the supraoccipital from the frontals; opercular bones well developed. Vertebral centra
  never advanced beyond the annular stage; ribs delicate; no fused or expanded haemal arches at the
  base of the tail; no epipleurals or epineurals. Fin-fulcra present, but usually small; dorsal and
  anal fins small, the former above or behind the ventral fins, which are small or may be absent.
  Scales ganoid, rhombic, those on the flanks united by peg-and-socket joints.</p>

  <p>This family, which appears to me to be related to the Dapediidae, is provisionally placed here
  by A. S. Woodward on account of its resemblance to the Leptolepididae, but it is not yet quite
  clear that the mandible was destitute of splenial and coronoid elements, while the bones at the
  base of the pectoral fin have not hitherto been observed. The principal genera are
  <i>Pholidophorus</i>, ranging from the Upper Trias to the Purbeck; <i>Thoracopterus</i>, from the
  Upper Trias; and <i>Pleuropholis</i>, from the Upper Jurassic. The species of <i>Pholidophorus</i>
  are very numerous in the Jurassic period, and Woodward has observed that the scales of the later
  species are more elaborately ornamented than those of earlier date.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Archaeomaenidae.</b>&mdash;Distinguished from the preceding by the thin, cycloid
  scales. Conspicuous obtuse ridge-scales are present along the dorsal and ventral lines.
  <i>Archaeomenes</i>, from the Jurassic (?) of New South Wales.</p>

  <p>This family is abundantly represented in Cretaceous times by the genera <i>Osmeroides</i> and
  <i>Elopopsis</i>, and from the Lower Eocene to the present day by <i>Elops</i> and
  <i>Megalops</i>. <i>Elops saurus</i> is a handsome elongate silvery Fish, found in all the warm
  and tropical seas; the young are ribbon-shaped like those of <i>Albula</i>. A second species,
  <i>E. lacerta</i>, is from the West Coast of Africa, entering rivers. <i>Megalops</i>,
  distinguished by larger scales, the absence of pseudobranchiae, and the curious prolongation of
  the last ray of the dorsal fin, includes the well-known Tarpon <i>M. atlanticus</i>, and the
  Indian <i>M. cyprinoides</i>. The Tarpon occurs from the south-eastern coasts of North America and
  the West Indies to Brazil, and reaches a length of 6 feet and a weight of 110 lbs. It often leaps
  out of the water, after the manner of Grey Mullets, and its chase when hooked affords good sport,
  the landing of so active a giant being attended with great difficulties. Its remarkably large
  scales, over two inches in diameter, are much prized for fancy work in the Florida curiosity
  shops.</p>

  <p>Curious-looking Fishes, very variable in the form of the head and body and in the extent of the
  fins. Mouth often very small; teeth in jaws usually few; teeth usually present on the
  parasphenoid, working against a similar patch on the glossohyal; eye covered over by skin,
  sometimes very indistinct; scales small, cycloid; branchiostegal rays 4 to 8. The dorsal and anal
  fins may be nearly equally developed (<i>Genyomyrus</i>, <i>Gnathonemus</i>); or the former
  (<i>Mormyrus</i>) or the latter (<i>Hyperopisus</i>) are several times the longer.
  <i>Gymnarchus</i>, Eel-shaped, apodal, and deprived of the caudal fin, lacks the anal fin, the
  dorsal extending over the whole extent of the body. Some species of <i>Mormyrops</i> show how a
  form <span class="pagenum" id="page550"><span class="smaller">{550}</span></span>like
  <i>Gymnarchus</i> may have been evolved out of a more typically-formed Fish. Nothing is more
  striking than the variation in shape of the snout within one and the same genus, and the names
  given to some of the species (<i>ovis</i>, <i>caballus</i>, <i>elephas</i>, <i>tamandua</i>,

  <p>The Mormyrids are highly remarkable for the enormous development of the brain, the weight of
  which equals <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">52</span> to <span
  class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">82</span> of the total, a thing unparalleled among
  lower Vertebrates; and for the problematic organ which surmounts it; also as being among the few
  Fishes in which an electric organ has been discovered. The organ, situated on each side of the
  caudal region, is derived from the muscular system and is of feeble power, as ascertained by
  Babuchin and by Fritsch; it was long considered as "pseudo-electric." The natural affinities of
  this family appear to be with the Albulidae, and there is nothing to justify the term "Nilhechte"
  (Nile-pike) which has been bestowed on them by German <span class="pagenum" id="page551"><span
  class="smaller">{551}</span></span>authors. Ninety-three species are known from the fresh waters
  of Africa north of the Tropic of Capricorn, and may be referred to two sub-families and ten
  genera<a id="NtA_643" href="#Nt_643"><sup>[643]</sup></a><span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>(i.) <span class="sc">Mormyrinae</span>, with teeth on the parasphenoid and tongue, with
  ventral, anal, and caudal fins, and a simple air-bladder; vertebrae 37 to 64; peculiar
  (Gemmingerian) linear bones, without known homologues, along each side of the tail, above and
  beneath the electric organ; scapular foramen in the scapula, or between the scapula and the
  coracoid. <i>Mormyrops, Petrocephalus, Isichthys, Marcusenius, Stomatorhinus, Myomyrus,
  Gnathonemus, Genyomyrus, Mormyrus</i>.</p>

  <p>(ii.) <span class="sc">Gymnarchinae</span>, without teeth on the parasphenoid and tongue,
  without ventral, anal, or caudal fins, and with a cellular air-bladder; vertebrae about 120;
  Gemmingerian bones absent; scapular foramen in the coracoid. <i>Gymnarchus</i>.</p>

  <p>Fossil Mormyrids are unknown.</p>

  <p>Venerated by the ancient Egyptians, the Mormyrs of the Nile are frequently represented on
  hieroglyphics and mural paintings as well as in bronze models. Very little is known of the habits
  of these Fishes. Prof. G. Fritsch, of Berlin, during his stay in Egypt for the purpose of
  experimenting on electric Fishes, observed that they perish very rapidly when removed from the
  river, and he had the greatest difficulty in keeping some alive in an aquarium for two or three
  days. The species with comparatively large mouths (<i>Mormyrops</i>, <i>Gymnarchus</i>) feed
  principally on fishes and crustaceans, the others on tiny animals and vegetable and more or less
  decomposed matter. Delhez, on the Congo, found that many are attracted to the borders of the river
  in the neighbourhood of human dwellings, where they feed on the refuse thrown into the water. It
  is probable that the species with a rostrum use it to procure small prey hidden between stones or
  buried in the mud, and that the fleshy mental appendage with which many are provided is a tactile
  organ compensating the imperfection of the vision in the search for food. A small Mormyrid from
  the Congo (<i>Stomatorhinus microps</i>) has the eyes so much reduced and the skin so feebly
  pigmented as to convey the impression of a cave Fish. Until quite recently, absolutely nothing was
  known <span class="pagenum" id="page552"><span class="smaller">{552}</span></span>of the breeding
  habits and development in this important family. To the late J. S. Budgett we owe some very
  interesting observations made in the Gambia on <i>Gymnarchus niloticus</i>.<a id="NtA_644"
  href="#Nt_644"><sup>[644]</sup></a> The Fish makes a floating nest, emerging on three sides, over
  which the male keeps a fierce watch; the recently-hatched larvae are remarkable for the enormous
  size of the yolk-sac, which hangs down, acting as a sort of anchor, and for the presence of long
  external branchial filaments, as in Selachian embryos. The Fish propels itself through the water
  entirely by the action of its dorsal fin, forwards and backwards with equal facility; when
  swimming rapidly backwards, it may be seen to use the end of its tail as a feeler to guide the
  way. Budgett has also identified, with some doubt, the eggs of <i>Hyperopisus bebe</i>, out of
  which emerged embryos not unlike those of some tailless Batrachians, which hung suspended to
  rootlets of grass in swamps by means of threads of viscid mucus secreted from glands on the top of
  the head.</p>

  the absence of oviducts. They differ in the absence of the lid-like supratemporal, the hole which
  it covers in <i>Hyodon</i> being here bordered by the post-frontal and the squamosal (fused with
  the opisthotic), sometimes also by the epiotic, in the absence of the suboperculum, in the absence
  or incomplete ossification of the upper branch of the post-temporal (the lower articulating with

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Dr. G&uuml;nther has directed attention to the remarkable <span class="pagenum" id="page558"><span
  class="smaller">{558}</span></span>coincidence of the geographical distribution of this family and
  the Dipneusti, although, however, the latter are not known to be represented in the Malay
  Archipelago. "Not only," he adds, "are the corresponding species found within the same region, but
  also in the same river systems; and although such a connexion may and must be partly due to a
  similarity of habit, yet the identity of this singular distribution is so striking that it can
  only be accounted for by assuming that the Osteoglossidae are one of the earliest Teleosteous
  types which have been contemporaries of and have accompanied the present Dipnoi since or even
  before the beginning of the Tertiary epoch."</p>

  <p>The Queensland species of <i>Scleropages</i> (<i>S. leichardti</i>) is known to the settlers by
  the name of Barramunda, which has also been applied to <i>Neoceratodus</i>. <i>Arapaima gigas</i>
  is one of the largest fresh-water Fishes known, exceeding a length of 15 feet and a weight of 400
  pounds. Its flesh is much valued. Sir R. Schomburgh has observed that the mother protects the
  young, who, for some time after their birth, always swim in front of her. A similar observation
  has been made in the Gambia on <i>Heterotis niloticus</i> by the late J. S. Budgett, who states
  that the Fish builds enormous nests in swamps, in about two feet of water; the walls of the nest
  are made of the stems of the grasses removed by the Fish from the centre; the floor is the
  swamp-bottom, and is made perfectly smooth and bare. The nest appears to be used for at most four
  or five days; the newly-hatched larvae are provided with long external gill-filaments of a
  blood-red colour.<a id="NtA_646" href="#Nt_646"><sup>[646]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 11. Pantodontidae.</b>&mdash;The little West African Fish described by Peters as
  <i>Pantodon buchholzi</i> is the unique representative of a family closely related to the
  Osteoglossidae, but distinguished by the very small, single praemaxillary and the absence of
  suboperculum and interoperculum. The pectoral fins are very large and are remarkable for the
  fleshy process to which the inner ray is adnate; the ventrals, formed of 7 rays, some of which are
  simple and prolonged into filaments, are placed more forward than in any other type of this
  sub-order, the Ctenothrissidae excepted, viz. immediately behind the pectorals. Teeth in the jaws

  only by two genera, of the Cretaceous period (England and Mount Lebanon), one with ctenoid scales

  <p>The remarkable little Fish, <i>Phractolaemus ansorgii</i>, discovered by Dr. W. J. Ansorge in
  the Niger Delta in 1900, and which has since also been found in the Congo, stands quite apart
  among the Malacopterygians, its nearest allies being apparently the Osteoglossidae. The body is
  elongate and subcylindrical, covered with large striated scales; the head is small, the skull
  strongly ossified, covered with thin skin; the mouth small, proboscidiform, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page561"><span class="smaller">{561}</span></span>capable of being thrust forwards, when at
  rest folded over and received into a depression on the upper surface of the head; the narial
  orifice is single, and preceded by a barbel; the gill-openings are narrow, restricted to the
  sides. The ventral fins are inserted far back, the dorsal and anal are short. The air-bladder is
  very large, and the intestine extremely long and much convoluted. Vertebrae 26 + 8.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 14. Saurodontidae.</b>&mdash;Margin of the upper jaw formed by the praemaxillaries and
  the maxillaries, the latter the more developed and firmly united to the former; these bones, as
  well as the mandible, with teeth implanted in deep sockets; palate toothless. Supraoccipital
  separating the small parietals; opercular bones well developed; symplectic present, exposed. Basis
  cranii double. Ribs sessile, very low down on the centra; no parapophyses; neural arches not fused
  with the centra. Pectorals inserted very low down; postclavicle apparently absent. Caudal fin
  deeply forked, without fused hypurals.</p>

  <p>This family, comprising several Cretaceous genera, may be regarded as ancestral to the
  <i>Chirocentridae</i>, with or near which it has been placed by Cope and various later authors.
  The normal position of the symplectic, however, entitles its members to rank as a separate family,
  and the autogenous neural arch, as well as the distinctness of the bones supporting the caudal
  fin, are also indicative of a greater generalisation. The restoration of <i>Ichthyodectes</i> as
  given by Loomis, shows a general form similar to an ordinary Herring, but it does not appear to be
  reliable.</p>

  <p>The members of the Saurodontidae have been referred to two groups: (<i>a</i>) with praedentary
  (praesymphysial) bone, <i>Saurocephalus</i>, <i>Saurodon</i>; (<i>b</i>) without praedentary,
  <i>Chirocentrites</i>, <i>Portheus</i>, <i>Ichthyodectes</i>, <i>Spathodactylus</i>,

  low down. Post-temporal forked; postclavicle absent; a thin bony lamina, similar to the
  postclavicle, above the pectoral fin, attached to the scapula; scapular foramen in scapula;
  coracoids in contact with each other, forming a keel. Ventrals very small, with 7 rays.
  Brachiostegal rays 8. Air-bladder large, not communicating with the ear, incompletely divided into
  cells. Mucous membrane of the intestine forming a spiral fold.</p>

  <p>Heralded by the genus <i>Thrissopater</i>,<a id="NtA_647" href="#Nt_647"><sup>[647]</sup></a>
  which may be regarded as a connecting type between the Elopidae and the Clupeidae, this family is
  largely represented in Cretaceous times, more abundantly still in the Eocene and Miocene, where
  <i>Clupea</i> and <i>Engraulis</i> occur in numerous species; <i>Hyperlophus</i>, distinguished
  from <i>Clupea</i> by the presence of a dorsal serrated ridge similar to the ventral, occurs in
  the Upper Cretaceous of Syria, Southern Europe, and South America, in the Eocene of North America
  and Europe, and is represented at the present day on the West Coast of South America and on the
  coast and in the rivers of New South Wales. About 200 Clupeids are known to live at the present
  day, mostly marine species, but a few are confined to fresh-waters; none may be termed deep-sea
  forms; some, like the Allis Shad (<i>Clupea alosa</i>) and Twait Shad (<i>C. finta</i>), are
  anadromous, ascending rivers to spawn. The range of the family is almost cosmopolitan. Several
  species are remarkable for the extreme abundance of individuals, as for example the Herring
  (<i>Clupea harengus</i>), the Pilchard or Sardine (<i>C. pilchardus</i>), and the Anchovy
  (<i>Engraulis encrasicholus</i>). The Herring inhabits the northern parts of the Atlantic and the
  seas north of Asia. As Dr. G&uuml;nther first showed, the so-called "Whitebait" consists chiefly of the
  fry of Herrings, which, like those of the Sprat (<i>C. sprattus</i>), have a predilection for
  brackish water. The Anchovy and the Pilchard, on the other hand, seldom if ever enter estuaries.
  The eggs of the Herring, contrary to those of most British marine food-fishes, are heavy and
  adhesive, sticking firmly to stones or fixed objects on the sea bottom, whilst those of the Sprat
  and Pilchard float on the surface. The larvae are long, slender, and transparent. The Sardine,
  which affords so valuable a fishery on the West Coast of France, is the immature state of the
  Pilchard, which grows to a length of 10 to 14 inches. Its movements are not yet well understood,
  and its scarcity during certain years in the waters where it usually swarms has caused periodical
  crises in an important industry. Ripe Pilchards are mostly found at a considerable distance from
  the coasts. The Anchovy is especially abundant in the <span class="pagenum" id="page565"><span
  class="smaller">{565}</span></span>Mediterranean, but it is also regularly fished in Holland,
  especially in the Zuydersee, where it breeds, as well as in the Mediterranean; it makes only
  temporary appearances, and has not been observed to spawn, in the English Channel, although eggs
  have recently been obtained off the coast of North Lancashire.<a id="NtA_648"
  href="#Nt_648"><sup>[648]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The imperfectly known Cretaceous Crossognathidae (<i>Crossognathus</i> and <i>Scyllaemus</i>),

  Clupeidae.</p>

  parietals, which may meet in a sagittal suture; opercular bones all well developed. Basis cranii
  double. Ribs sessile, parapophyses very short or absent; epineurals, sometimes also epipleurals,
  present. Post-temporal forked, the upper branch attached to the epiotic, the lower to the
  opisthotic; postclavicle, as usual, applied to inner side of clavicle. A small adipose dorsal fin.
  Air-bladder usually present, large. Oviducts rudimentary or absent, the ova falling into the

  <p>Marine and fresh-water Fishes, mostly from the temperate and Arctic zones of the northern

  2000 fathoms. Apparently of comparatively recent age, no remains older than Miocene

  </div>

  <p>The beauty, gameness, and great economical value of the Salmonids have caused more attention to
  be bestowed on them than probably upon any other group of fishes. As Professor Smitt tells us, a
  Swedish proverb says "A dear child has many names," and this applies well to our Salmon and Trout,
  the species of which have been unduly multiplied by some writers. The genus <i>Salmo</i>,
  characterised by a large mouth and powerful dentition, is divided into three sections:
  <i>Oncorhynchus</i>, Quinnat Salmon, of the North Pacific, ascending rivers in North America and
  Asia, with 12 to 17 developed rays in the anal; <i>Salmo</i>, Salmon and Trout, with 8 to 12 rays
  in the anal, and teeth not only on the head of the vomer but also along its shaft, at least in the
  young, <span class="pagenum" id="page567"><span class="smaller">{567}</span></span>represented in
  the seas and freshwaters of Europe, Asia, and North America, extending southwards to North-West
  Africa, Asia Minor, Northern Persia, the Hindu Kush, the head of the Gulf of California, and the
  Rio Grande; <i>Salvelinus</i>, Charr, with 8 to 10 rays in the anal, and teeth on the raised head
  of the vomer only, of the lakes of Northern and Central Europe and the rivers of the northern
  parts of Asia and North America as far north as 82&deg; 34&acute;, sometimes descending to the sea.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      &#x2153;. (After Valenciennes.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The changes in form and colour which these fishes undergo when passing from fresh water into
  the sea or when artificially transported from one place to another are very great, and this
  plasticity, together with the connecting links which render the naming of not a few specimens
  impossible, have caused most recent students of the genus <i>Salmo</i>, in Europe at least, to
  reduce many of the so-called species to the rank of local varieties, and even our common Brown
  Trout or Brook Trout (<i>S. fario</i>) is now generally regarded as not specifically separable
  from the anadromous Sea Trout (<i>S. trutta</i>). The anadromous true Salmon (<i>S. salar</i>) may
  be distinguished by its somewhat larger scales, there being only 11 or 12 in a transverse series
  running from the posterior border of the adipose fin forwards to the lateral line, Trout having 13
  to 16. The Charr of the lakes of Wales, the North of England, Scotland, and Ireland are also
  regarded as mere varieties of the common Northern migratory Charr (<i>S. alpinus</i>), of which
  the "Omble Chevalier" of the Swiss lakes and the "Saeblings" of the Alpine lakes of Germany and
  Austria are likewise varieties. An allied species (<i>S. fontinalis</i>) has been introduced into
  England from North America, as well as a true Trout (<i>S. irideus</i>). The large size of the
  eggs, their lack of <span class="pagenum" id="page568"><span
  class="smaller">{568}</span></span>adhesiveness, and the fact that the ova fall into the abdominal
  cavity, out of which they may easily be squeezed, renders artificial impregnation particularly
  easy, and the species of <i>Salmo</i> have always occupied the first place in the annals of
  fish-culture. Fertilised eggs are transported in ice, the development being simply suspended for
  several weeks, and several forms of British and American Salmonidae have thus been introduced into
  New Zealand and Tasmania, where some have thoroughly established themselves.</p>

  <p>The White-Fish, <i>Coregonus</i>, are more numerous in species than <i>Salmo</i>, and as a rule
  more readily defined. They are easily recognised by their large silvery scales and their smaller
  mouth without or with minute teeth. Some, like the Houting (<i>C. oxyrhynchus</i>) of Northern
  Europe, occur in the sea, entering rivers to spawn, whilst others, like the Sik, Weiss, Felchen,
  or Lavaret (<i>C. lavaretus</i>), are confined to lakes. British species are the Gwyniad (<i>C.
  clupeoides</i>), of Loch Lomond, Haweswater, Ullswater, and Bala, the Vendace (<i>C.
  vandesius</i>), of Loch Maben, and the Pollan (<i>C. pollan</i>) of Lough Neagh in Ireland.</p>

  <p>The Grayling (<i>Thymallus vulgaris</i> or <i>vexillifer</i>), with its high dorsal fin formed
  of about 20 rays, one of the handsomest British fishes, inhabits the rivers and lakes of Northern
  and Central Europe, and is represented by a few allied species in Asia and North America. It
  derives its name from having the odour of thyme.</p>

  <p>The Smelt (<i>Osmerus eperlanus</i>) breeds in salt water, and although it often enters rivers,
  it does not ascend beyond tidal influence. The Capelin (<i>Mallotus villosus</i>), of the coasts
  of Arctic America and North-eastern Asia, deposits its eggs in the sand along the shores in
  incredible numbers, the beach becoming a <span class="pagenum" id="page569"><span
  class="smaller">{569}</span></span>quivering mass of eggs and sand. <i>Plecoglossus</i>, from
  Japan and Formosa, is highly remarkable for its lamellar, comb-like, lateral teeth. The
  Siel-Smelts (<i>Argentina</i>) are deep-sea Salmonids of which examples have occasionally been
  taken off the coasts of Scotland and Ireland; large numbers have been brought from Norway to
  English markets. <i>Bathylagus</i> is still better adapted for life at great depths (down to 1700
  fathoms), the eyes being of enormous size. As Dr. G&uuml;nther has observed, "these fishes must be
  entirely dependent for vision on the phosphorescent light which is produced by other abyssal
  creatures. Not being fish of prey themselves, or only to a slight degree, they would be attracted
  by the light issuing from the Pediculates and Stomiatids of the deep, and thus form an easy prey
  to these fishes."</p>

  <p>Secondary sexual characters are very strongly developed in many Salmonids. In adult males of
  Salmon, Trout, and Quinnat the snout becomes greatly distorted, both jaws being hooked and the
  base of the teeth more or less enlarged; in the latter species a fleshy hump is developed before
  the dorsal fin, and the scales of the back become embedded in the flesh. Pearl-like excrescences
  appear on the scales of many of the White-Fish during the breeding season, being more prominent in
  males than in females, and <i>Mallotus villosus</i> is so called from the villous bands formed by
  the scales of mature males, the scales above the lateral line and along each side of the belly
  becoming elongate-lanceolate, densely imbricated and produced into free, projecting points.<a

  <p>The Pachyrhizodontidae, with the Cretaceous genus <i>Pachyrhizodus</i>, are placed by some
  authors with the Salmonidae, but the remains at present known are too fragmentary to afford a
  correct idea of their exact systematic position. There seems to be less justification for placing
  them among the Elopidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 18. Alepocephalidae.</b>&mdash;Deep-sea Fishes similar in general structure to the
  Clupeidae and Salmonidae, but destitute of a postclavicle and of an adipose dorsal fin,<a
  id="NtA_650" href="#Nt_650"><sup>[650]</sup></a> the rayed fin being situated far back on the
  body, in the caudal region, and opposed <span class="pagenum" id="page570"><span
  class="smaller">{570}</span></span>or slightly anterior to the anal. The skeleton of
  <i>Alepocephalus</i><a id="NtA_651" href="#Nt_651"><sup>[651]</sup></a> is remarkable for its
  feeble ossification. Epipleurals and epineurals are present, and the bilateral division of the
  neural arch remains perfectly distinct throughout the praecaudal region, both halves being very
  loosely apposed. The air-bladder is absent. Ventrals are absent in <i>Platytroctes</i>, and the
  snout is much produced in <i>Aulostomatomorpha</i>.</p>

  <p>Eleven genera are distinguished:&mdash;A, with scales: <i>Alepocephalus</i>, <i>Conocara</i>,
  <i>Bathytroctes</i>, <i>Leptochilichthys</i>, <i>Narcetes</i>, <i>Platytroctes</i>,
  <i>Aulostomatomorpha</i>. B, without scales:&mdash;<i>Xenodermichthys</i>, <i>Aleposomus</i>,
  <i>Leptoderma</i>, <i>Anomalopterus</i>.</p>

  <p>Represented by about 35 species in nearly all the seas; as usual with deep-sea forms,
  individuals of the same species have been obtained from stations very remote from one another.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 19. Stomiatidae.</b>&mdash;I would unite under this name the Stomiatidae and
  Sternoptychidae of G&uuml;nther, an assemblage of aberrant deep-sea Fishes which agree in having the
  maxillary bone more developed than the praemaxillary, and beset with teeth, a character which
  differentiates them at once from all other deep-sea forms of this sub-order, as well as from the
  Scopelidae among the Haplomi. The ventral fins are usually inserted very far back, and the number
  of their rays varies from 5 to 8. Contrary to what occurs in other groups of fishes, the pectoral
  fins have a tendency to reduction, and actually disappear in some genera, whilst the ventrals
  remain well developed; whenever the pectoral fins are fully developed, as in <i>Maurolicus</i>,
  <i>Chauliodus</i>, <i>Astronesthes</i>, and <i>Photichthys</i>, the mesocoracoid arch is
  present.<a id="NtA_652" href="#Nt_652"><sup>[652]</sup></a> The form of the body varies
  exceedingly, even within the smaller groups into which this family has been divided; it may be
  excessively short and compressed, or excessively elongate, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page571"><span class="smaller">{571}</span></span>but the mouth and eyes are always large,
  these fish being essentially predatory; the dentition is often very powerful, and may extend to
  the palate or be confined to the jaws. The body is naked or scaly; luminous spots (photophores)
  are more or less developed.<a id="NtA_653" href="#Nt_653"><sup>[653]</sup></a> The development and
  position of the vertical fin is highly variable within this group, and the several families which
  have been founded upon this character have no more taxonomic importance than in the
  better-understood groups <i>Characinidae</i> and <i>Siluridae</i>. All authors, besides, have been
  compelled to admit that the presence or absence of an adipose dorsal fin has no high significance
  in this case, a view which is further strengthened by Dr. Gilchrist's discovery, off the Cape of
  Good Hope, of a deep-sea Fish agreeing in every respect with <i>Astronesthes</i>, but for the
  presence of a small adipose fin, absolutely similar to the dorsal, but situated on the ventral
  side, immediately in front of the anus. Two species with similar ventral adipose fins have just
  been discovered by Dr. Brauer and referred to <i>Astronesthes</i>. I am therefore unable to adopt
  the elaborate arrangement in favour with the modern American school.</p>

  <p>This family, comprising about 55 species, has a world-wide distribution, but most of the known
  forms have been obtained from the Atlantic; some of the species occur both in the Atlantic and the
  Indo-Pacific. <i>Chauliodus</i>, <i>Astronesthes</i>, and <i>Stomias</i> are among the fishes with
  the most formidable dentition.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 20. Gonorhynchidae.</b>&mdash;Margin of the upper jaw formed by the praemaxillaries and

  Praecaudal vertebrae with strong parapophyses, to the extremity of which slender ribs and

  <p>The single existing species, <i>Gonorhynchus greyi</i>, is characterised by an elongate,
  cylindrical body, a pointed projecting snout bearing a single barbel, short dorsal and anal fins,
  the former opposed to the ventrals, and the gill-membranes broadly attached to the isthmus. Teeth
  are present on the pterygoid and hyoid bones. No suborbital arch. Vertebrae, 45 + 20. Air-bladder
  absent. Its distribution is a very wide one, the species being on record from the coasts of the
  Cape of Good Hope, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Notogoneus</i>, from the freshwater Eocene beds of France and North America, has
  been referred to this family by Cope, and has been shown by A. S. Woodward to be closely related
  to <i>Gonorhynchus</i>, differing only in the absence of teeth on the palate and tongue, and in
  the more forward position of the dorsal fin. The genus <i>Charitosomus</i>, with several species
  <span class="pagenum" id="page573"><span class="smaller">{573}</span></span>from the Upper
  Cretaceous of Westphalia and Mount Lebanon, has also been included in this family, but the precise
  shape and character of the scales have not yet been ascertained.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 21. Cromeriidae.</b>&mdash;Margin of the upper jaw formed by the praemaxillaries and
  the maxillaries. Supraoccipital large and widely separating the very small parietals; opercular
  bones well developed; symplectic absent. Basis cranii simple. Mouth small and toothless, inferior;
  gill-opening narrow. Three branchiostegal rays. Body naked. Praecaudal vertebrae with
  parapophyses; ribs and epipleurals slender. No postclavicle. Pectoral fin inserted low down,
  folding like the ventrals.</p>

  <p class="sp3">A single genus, <i>Cromeria</i>, recently discovered in the White Nile. In its
  elongate, naked body and the posterior position of the dorsal fin, it resembles the Galaxiidae, to
  which it was at first referred. But this allocation has proved to be incorrect, now that the
  osteological structure of the minute Fish (only about 30 mm. long) has been worked out by
  Swinnerton.<a id="NtA_654" href="#Nt_654"><sup>[654]</sup></a> The vertebrae number 42 to 45
  (28-30 + 14-15). A long, slender air-bladder is present.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order 2. Ostariophysi.</b></p>

  <p>Air-bladder, if well developed, communicating with the digestive tract by a duct. Pectoral arch
  suspended from the skull; mesocoracoid arch present. Fins without spines, or dorsal and pectoral
  with a single spine formed by the co-ossification of the segments of an articulated ray. The
  anterior four vertebrae strongly modified, often co-ossified and bearing a chain of small bones
  (so-called Weberian ossicles) connecting the air-bladder with the ear.</p>

  <p>This is one of the most natural groups of the Class Pisces, although its members are so
  diversified in outward appearance as to have been widely separated in the systems of older
  authors. It is to Sagemehl<a id="NtA_655" href="#Nt_655"><sup>[655]</sup></a> that is due the
  credit of having first grouped, under the above name, the Characines, the Carps, the Cat-Fishes,
  and the Gymnotids, the relations of which had been realised, to a certain extent, by Cope. But it
  was not until the homology throughout the group of the ossicula auditus, first described by E. H.
  Weber in 1820, had been demonstrated by Sagemehl that the justification for the course here
  followed appeared in its full <span class="pagenum" id="page574"><span
  class="smaller">{574}</span></span>strength, as such an agreement in the structure of so
  complicated and specialised an apparatus can only be the result of a community of descent of the
  families which are possessed of it. It is invariably the anterior four vertebrae that take part in
  the support of the Weberian apparatus. The first vertebra is much reduced; its upper arch is
  absent and replaced by the ossicles termed <i>claustrum</i> and <i>scaphium</i><a id="NtA_656"
  href="#Nt_656"><sup>[656]</sup></a> (the former being perhaps nothing but the modified neural
  arch), which fill in the space between the exoccipital and the neural arch of the second vertebra;
  the principal piece of the apparatus, the <i>tripus</i>, variable in form, is related to the third
  vertebra, of which it is regarded as a modified rib; a fibrous ligament extends from the anterior
  extremity of the <i>tripus</i> to the <i>scaphium</i>, and in this ligament is inserted the fourth
  piece, the <i>intercalarium</i>. The various forms of this sub-order also show a complete
  agreement in the spinal nerves which pass through these ossicles. The parietal bones either
  separate the frontals from the supraoccipital or are fused with the latter.</p>

  <p>This sub-order is divided into six families. The Characinids are the most generalised, and the
  others are probably derived from them in the manner expressed by the following diagram<span

  <p>The genera in the above sub-families are mostly founded on the dentition and the extent of the
  praemaxillary and maxillary bones, which are astonishingly varied, as may be seen from the annexed
  figures showing the open mouths of a few of the most remarkable types. As I have already pointed
  out, the character often given as diagnostic of this family, viz. the maxillary forming part of
  the oral border, is not absolutely constant; this bone is often much reduced, and it is entirely
  excluded from the mouth in <i>Ichthyoborus</i> and <i>Neoborus</i>. The branchiostegal rays <span
  class="pagenum" id="page577"><span class="smaller">{577}</span></span>number 3 to 5 only. The fins
  never bear pungent spines, and the ventrals have 6 to 13 rays. Barbels are absent. In most of the
  herbivorous forms the brain-case is produced forward to the nasal capsule, whilst in most of the
  carnivorous forms they are separated by an interorbital septum; but there are exceptions to this
  correlation, and as otherwise closely related genera may differ in this respect, I have not been
  able to make use of the character in defining sub-families.</p>

  <p>The air-bladder is divided into an anterior and a posterior part by a constriction; the

  <i>Lebiasina</i>. Pyloric appendages to the stomach, which are constantly absent in the Cyprinids,

  <p>The appearance and habits of the genera which compose this family vary greatly. Some resemble
  the Cyprinids and are mainly vegetarians, whilst others recall Salmonids and Pike. Among the most
  formidable are <i>Hydrocyon</i>, the Dogs of the Water, or Kelb-el-Bahr of the Arabs, with their
  powerful jaws with shark-like teeth, visible when the mouth is closed, and which grow to the size
  of the Salmon. The five known species inhabit the Nile and the rivers and lakes of tropical
  Africa. No less ferocious are the "Piranha" or "Cariba" (<i>Serrasalmo</i>) of South America,
  whose bite has been compared to the cut of a razor. They abound in some rivers and are much
  dreaded by people having to enter the water, as they fiercely bite off big pieces of flesh as with
  a pair of scissors, and the smell of blood is said to attract them by thousands; they show a great
  tenacity of life and can remain for hours out of the water. <i>Serrasalmo niger</i> has been
  observed by Schomburgk to produce a grunting noise in the water. <i>Salminus orbignianus</i>, of
  the Plate River, "Dorado" of the Spaniards, which reaches a length of 3 feet, has the predacious
  habits of the Pike, and follows other fishes moving in shoals; its flesh is much valued, although
  very full of bones, like that of all Characinids.</p>

  <p>As an example of phytophagous types may be mentioned the Moon-Fish of the Nile (<i>Citharinus
  geoffroyi</i>), with its feeble dentition, deep compressed body, and falciform dorsal fin; it is
  often represented on the monuments of the ancient Egyptians.<a id="NtA_657"

  <p>The best known member of this family is the so-called Electric Eel (<i>Gymnotus
  electricus</i>), of the Orinoco, Amazons, and intermediate river-systems. It grows to a length of
  8 feet and the thickness of a man's thigh, and is much feared for the electric shocks it is able
  to discharge. The "Tremblador," as it is called by the Spanish-speaking inhabitants of the Orinoco
  district, is found only in marshes and in comparatively shallow parts of rivers, to the great
  annoyance of travellers who have to ford at such points, beasts of burden being frequently knocked
  down by the electric shock. Specimens have often been exhibited alive in this country; two brought
  to London in the year 1842, neither of them weighing more than one pound, had by 1848 reached the
  weights of 40 and 50 pounds respectively. About four-fifths of the length of the fish is occupied
  by the tail, which contains the electric organ; this is formed by modified muscular tissue, and
  consists of two huge masses, longitudinal bands or columns, of cells filled with a jelly-like
  substance, occupying the whole of the caudal region below the vertebral column and separated by a
  narrow median septum; a smaller body, of similar structure, extends along each side at the base of
  the anal fin. The whole apparatus is supplied with a great number of nerves branching from the
  spinal nerves. The electrical apparatus is exercised by the will of the fish, even to <span
  class="pagenum" id="page581"><span class="smaller">{581}</span></span>a distance, but this faculty
  is exhausted by continuous employment, and is recovered during repose. Although apparently not
  exempt from exaggeration and fable, Humboldt's account in <i>Observations de Zoologie</i>, p. 497,
  is recommended for further information on the habits and modes of capture of <i>Gymnotus</i>.<a

  bones united in a sagittal suture, or separated by a fontanelle; opercular bones well developed;
  symplectic present. Lower pharyngeal bones falciform, subparallel to the branchial arches,
  provided with teeth arranged in one, two, or three series, and often remarkably specialised. Ribs

  <p>The Cyprinids constitute the majority of the freshwater fishes in Europe, Asia, and North
  America; they are comparatively few (about 100 species) in Africa, where they coexist with the
  Characinids. Some, like the Carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio</i>) and the Tench (<i>Tinca vulgaris</i>),
  are sluggish, except during the breeding season, when they show great excitement and indulge in
  leaps out of the water; others, like the Bleak (<i>Alburnus lucidus</i>) are constantly on the
  move in large shoals near the surface; whilst others again, like the M&lsquo;Biriki of Lake
  Tanganyika (<i>Barbus tropidolepis</i>), behave after the manner of Salmon and Trout, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page584"><span class="smaller">{584}</span></span>travelling long distances,
  against rapids and over waterfalls, to reach their breeding places at the heads of rivers. During
  the breeding season, the males of many species assume a more brilliant livery, or develop
  pearl-like or spiny excrescences on various parts of the head, or also on the body and fins.<a
  id="NtA_662" href="#Nt_662"><sup>[662]</sup></a> Cyprinids are oviparous, with the exception of a
  small Barbel from Natal, discovered and described by Prof. Max Weber as <i>Barbus
  viviparus</i>.</p>

  <p>A most striking instance of symbiosis is offered by a little Carp-like fish of Central Europe,
  the "Bitterling" (<i>Rhodeus amarus</i>). The genital papilla of the female acquires a great
  development during the breeding season, becoming produced into a tube nearly as long as the fish
  itself; by means of this ovipositor the comparatively few and remarkably large eggs, measuring 3
  millimetres in diameter&mdash;the fish being only 60 to 80 millimetres long&mdash;are introduced
  through the gaping valves, between the branchial laminae of pond mussels (<i>Unio</i> and
  <i>Anodonta</i>) where, after being inseminated, they undergo their development, the fry leaving
  their host about a month later, having attained a length of 10 or 11 millimetres.<a id="NtA_663"
  href="#Nt_663"><sup>[663]</sup></a> The mollusc reciprocates by throwing off its embryos on the
  parent fish, in the skin of which they remain encysted for some time, the period of reproduction
  of the fish and mussel coinciding.</p>

  <p>Some members of this family grow to a very large size,&mdash;4 to 6 feet; such is the case with
  the Carp, a native of Asia, introduced into England towards the beginning of the seventeenth
  century; the Catla (<i>Catla buchanani</i>) of India, Burma, and Siam; the Mahaseer (<i>Barbus
  mosal</i>) of the mountain streams of Asia, the scales of which may be as large as the palm of a
  hand; and <i>Hypophthalmichthys molitrix</i> of China and Manchuria, remarkable for the low
  position of the eyes, the fusion of the gill-rakers into thin plates of spongious appearance,
  which must act as a most efficient sifting apparatus, and the presence of an involuted problematic
  superbranchial organ to each branchial arch.<a id="NtA_664"
  href="#Nt_664"><sup>[664]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Among well-known aberrations produced by artificial selection may be mentioned the "Leather
  Carp," a race in which the scales are either lost or much reduced in number, and enlarged <span
  class="pagenum" id="page585"><span class="smaller">{585}</span></span>along the lateral line and
  the back, and the Gold-Fish, a variety of <i>Cyprinus carassius</i>, remarkable for its golden or
  bright red colour, or its perfect albinism, as well as its monstrous form the Telescope Fish, with
  enormously projecting eyes, and enlarged, horizontally spread caudal fin.<a id="NtA_665"
  href="#Nt_665"><sup>[665]</sup></a> This family has also yielded numerous more or less
  well-established examples of hybridism, congeneric and digeneric, originally described as distinct
  species, the produce of which is believed to be in some cases fertile for at least one
  generation.</p>

  <p>The crystalline silvery colouring matter of various Cyprinids is said to have been employed
  from time immemorial for ornamental purposes by the Chinese. The well-known and important industry
  of "Essence Orientale" and artificial pearls, carried on in France and Germany with the scales of
  the Bleak, was not introduced before the middle of the seventeenth century.</p>

  <p>The Loaches, Cobitidinae, which form a very natural sub-family, are small fishes, few species
  growing to a foot in length, mostly living in small streams and ponds. Many delight in the mud at
  the bottom, in which they move like Eels. In some cases, the branchial respiration appears to be
  insufficient, and the intestinal tract acts as an accessory breathing organ. The air-bladder,
  which is partially encased in a bony capsule, may be so reduced as to lose its hydrostatic
  functions and becomes transformed into a sensory organ, its outer exposed surface being connected
  with the skin by a meatus between the bands of muscle, and conveying the thermo-barometrical
  impressions to the auditory nerves; hence the name of "Wetterfisch," by which Loaches are known in
  some parts of Germany.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Siluridae.</b>&mdash;Mouth non-protractile, bordered by the praemaxillaries and the
  maxillaries, or by the praemaxillaries only, the maxillaries being often rudimentary and
  supporting the base of a barbel; jaws usually toothed. Parietal bones usually confluent with the
  supraoccipital, forming a single large plate (parieto-occipital); symplectic and suboperculum
  absent. Pharyngeal bones normal, with small teeth. Ribs attached to the lower surface of long
  parapophyses; epipleurals absent. Pectoral fins inserted very low down, folding like the ventrals,
  often armed, like the dorsal, with a strong bony spine. Body naked or with bony plates. An adipose
  dorsal fin often present. One to four pairs of barbels.</p>

  <p>The skull and the opercular apparatus show a reduction in the number of elements as compared
  with the Characinids and Cyprinids, such as the absence of the metapterygoid, the often
  rudimentary, rod-like condition of the palatine, and the fusion of the parietals with the
  supraoccipital.<a id="NtA_667" href="#Nt_667"><sup>[667]</sup></a> The scapular arch is solidly
  united to the skull and is often very massive, and the occiput may be connected with the base of
  the dorsal fin by a buckler formed by the expansion of the first and second inter-neural bones.
  The pterygials or supports of the pectoral rays are large and reduced to two or three.<a
  id="NtA_668" href="#Nt_668"><sup>[668]</sup></a> Teeth are rarely present <span class="pagenum"
  id="page587"><span class="smaller">{587}</span></span>on the maxillary bones (<i>Diplomystes</i>,
  <i>Eutropiichthys</i>), being usually confined to the praemaxillaries and dentaries; they often
  occur on the palate. The branchiostegal rays vary from 4 to 17. The lips are sometimes much
  developed, and may form a sucking disk, as in <i>Euchilichthys</i> and <i>Exostoma</i>. As in the
  Cyprinids, the pungent spines which may arm the fins have nothing in common with the true spines
  of Acanthopterygians; they result from the co-ossification, with age, of successive articles; but,
  contrary to the condition in the Cyprinids, the axis of the spine is single, not double. The
  ventral rays vary from 6 to 16, 6 being the most frequent number. Some of the exterior vertebrae
  may be solidly fused together, and also with the occipito-nuchal buckler. Prof. Ramsay Wright<a
  id="NtA_669" href="#Nt_669"><sup>[669]</sup></a> has shown, by a study of the development, that
  the complex which follows the first vertebra, which is more or less rudimentary, if distinct,
  represents the fusion of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th vertebrae, without even nerve-foramina denoting its
  compound origin; the first, strongly developed, transverse process represents that of the 4th
  vertebra. The air-bladder is usually large and trilocular, but additional septa may greatly
  complicate its structure, and external diverticula may also exist;<a id="NtA_670"
  href="#Nt_670"><sup>[670]</sup></a> it may be more or less reduced and entirely or partially
  enclosed in a bilateral bony capsule formed by the transverse processes of the vertebrae, and
  sometimes (<i>Nematogenys</i>) ankylosed to the skull. In a few genera, like <i>Cetopsis</i>, the
  air-bladder seems to be altogether absent: it is reduced to two small oval sacs encased in the
  large compound anterior vertebra. As in Loaches, the air-bladder is often in immediate contact
  with the skin behind the shoulder-girdle. The intestinal tract may be simple and short
  (carnivorous forms) or extremely long and convoluted (<i>Callichthys</i>); as in Cyprinids,
  pyloric appendages are absent.</p>

  <p>Cat-Fishes, as Silurids are usually called, are a large family embracing some 1000 species,

  <p>Our knowledge of the distribution in time of the Silurids is still very scanty, and throws no
  light on the derivation of the group. <i>Arius</i>, and two genera apparently related to it,
  <i>Rhineaster</i> and <i>Bucklandium</i>, have left remains in the Eocene of Europe and North
  America, and traces of various recent genera have been found in later Tertiary deposits in Europe,
  Asia, and North and South America.</p>

  <p>The habits of the Silurids are extremely diversified, and the shape of the body varies
  accordingly. The body may be very short and the head enormous and excessively depressed, for
  instance in the Indo-Burmese <i>Chaca lophioides</i>, which, as its name implies, resembles the
  Fishing-Frog or Angler; stout and <i>Cottus</i>-like in some South American <i>Pimelodus</i>;
  Loach-like in <i>Trichomycterus</i> and <i>Stegophilus</i>; more or less Eel-shaped in
  <i>Clarias</i> and its allies, etc.; the extreme of slenderness obtains in the African
  <i>Channalabes</i>, the body being excessively elongate (over 100 vertebrae), the ventral fins
  absent, and the pectorals rudimentary or absent. Among other remarkable forms may be mentioned the
  Indian <i>Sisor</i>, which resembles <i>Aspredo</i>, and in which the upper caudal ray is much
  thickened and greatly prolonged; <i>Pseudecheneis</i>, living in rapids of the Himalayas and
  Khasia hills, provided with a transversely plaited ventral disk between the pectoral fins; the
  African <i>Phractura</i> and <i>Andersonia</i>, resembling <i>Loricaria</i>; and the likewise
  African <i>Belonoglanis</i>, comparable to a Needle-Fish. The spines which so frequently arm the
  dorsal and pectoral fins may be barbed or serrated, and constitute formidable defensive weapons;
  in the South American <i>Ageniosus valenciennesi</i>, the maxillary bone is transformed into a
  strong, barbed, erectile spine, replacing the barbel. Stings of even the smaller Cat-Fish are at
  least as painful as that of a bee, and this is probably due to some poisonous property of the
  dermal secretion of the Fish.</p>

  <p>Cope believed an orifice at or above the axil of the pectoral fin in <i>Noturus</i> to be the
  opening of the duct of a poison-gland; "from it may frequently be drawn a solid gelatinous style
  ending in a tripod, each limb of which is dichotomously divided into short branches of regular
  length." I think this condition of things has nothing to do with a poison-organ, and is merely a
  repetition of what is observed in Loaches and in the Characinid <i>Xenocharax</i>, where I have
  found a gelatinous substance filling the short duct by which the membrane of the air-bladder is
  placed in communication with the skin and the sensory organ of the lateral line. Most Silurids can
  live in very foul water, taking in air from the surface, and spend a comparatively long time out
  of the water, without being possessed of any special apparatus for atmospheric respiration. A few
  genera, however, are provided with an accessory breathing organ: in <i>Clarias</i>,
  <i>Heterobranchus</i>, and allies, there is a dendritic superbranchial organ, in
  <i>Saccobranchus</i> a long air-sac, extending from the first branchial cleft along the side of
  the body, as described above, <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page295">295</a></span>; and these
  Fish can live for days on land. <i>Clarias lazera</i> has been observed, in Senegambia, to spend
  several months of the dry season in burrows, from which it emerges at night to crawl about in
  search of food. Many Silurids, but especially <i>Doras</i> and <i>Synodontis</i>, are known to
  produce sounds in and out of the water by means of a special mechanism of the air-bladder and the
  processes of the vertebrae above it, combined with the movements of the pectoral spine grinding in
  the glenoid cavity.<a id="NtA_672" href="#Nt_672"><sup>[672]</sup></a> In South America,
  <i>Doras</i> has been observed to move rapidly on land, projecting itself forward on the pectoral
  spines by the elastic spring of the tail, travelling long journeys over land, from one drying pond
  to another, spending whole nights on the way; these migrations sometimes take place <span
  class="pagenum" id="page591"><span class="smaller">{591}</span></span>in numerous bands, baskets
  of the small Fish being filled by the Indians who come across them.<a id="NtA_673"
  href="#Nt_673"><sup>[673]</sup></a> The African <i>Synodontis</i> are much in the habit of
  floating or swimming leisurely on the surface with the belly in the air, as was well known to the
  ancient Egyptians, who have frequently depicted the Fish in this anomalous position. A curious
  fact in connexion with this habit is that <i>S. membranaceus</i> and <i>S. batensoda</i>, in which
  it has most frequently been observed, show an inversion of the ordinary mode of coloration, the
  lower parts being dark brown or black and the upper pale silvery grey. The electric Cat-Fish
  (<i>Malopterurus electricus</i>), is also a native of Africa, occurring all over the tropical
  parts of that continent and also in the Lower Nile, growing to a length of three feet. Its flesh
  is more esteemed than that of other Silurids. It avoids light and is slow in its movements. The
  electrical apparatus differs absolutely from that of all other Fishes, being derived from the
  integument, belonging to the glandular system, and surrounding the whole body with a thick coat of
  grease or gelatinous substance; the apparatus is governed by a single nerve on each side
  proceeding from a huge ganglionic cell at the anterior extremity of the spinal cord.<a
  id="NtA_674" href="#Nt_674"><sup>[674]</sup></a> The shocks given by <i>Madopterurus</i> are very
  powerful, and the Fish is called "Raad" by the Arabs, a name which means "thunder." Kept in an
  aquarium with other Fishes, even of the same species, the "Raad" soon kills its companions.</p>

  <p>In this family the eggs and young are usually looked after by the parents. Aristotle observed
  that the male of the European <i>Silurus glanis</i> watches over and defends the eggs. In one of
  the commonest North American Cat-Fishes, <i>Amiurus nebulosus</i>, a species which has been
  largely introduced into some parts of Europe of late, now thriving in many ponds and more or less
  polluted streams of the Continent, the eggs are deposited near the banks of weedy ponds and rivers
  without currents, in concealed places beneath logs, stumps, or even in pails or other receptacles,
  failing which both parents join in excavating a sort of nest in the mud, a work often requiring
  two or three days of incessant labour. The male watches over the eggs, and later leads the young
  in great schools near the shore, seemingly caring for them as the hen for her chickens.<a
  id="NtA_675" href="#Nt_675"><sup>[675]</sup></a> The <i>Doras</i> and the <i>Callichthys</i> of
  South America, according to Hancock<a id="NtA_676" href="#Nt_676"><sup>[676]</sup></a> and
  Vipan,<a id="NtA_677" href="#Nt_677"><sup>[677]</sup></a> build regular nests of grass or leaves,
  sometimes placed in a hole scooped out in the bank, in which they cover their eggs and defend
  them, male and female sharing in this parental duty. In the likewise South American
  <i>Corydoras</i> (<i>Callichthys paleatus</i>), as observed by Carbonnier,<a id="NtA_678"
  href="#Nt_678"><sup>[678]</sup></a> a lengthy courtship takes place, followed by an embrace,
  during which the female receives the seminal fluid in a sort of pouch formed by the folded
  membranes of her ventral fins; immediately after, five or six eggs are produced and received in
  the pouch, to be afterwards carefully placed in a secluded spot. This operation is repeated many
  times, until the total number of eggs, about 250, have been deposited. In <span class="pagenum"
  id="page593"><span class="smaller">{593}</span></span>accordance with these pairing habits, the
  pectoral spines of the male, which are used in amplexation, are longer and stronger than those of
  the female. These Fish are monogamous, and both parents remain by the side of the nest, furiously
  attacking any assailant. Dr. R. Semon<a id="NtA_679" href="#Nt_679"><sup>[679]</sup></a> has made
  observations in Queensland on the habits of <i>Arius australis</i>, which builds nests in the
  sandy bed of the Burnett River. These nests consist of circular basin-like excavations, about 20
  inches in diameter, at the bottom of which the eggs are laid, and covered over by several layers
  of large stones. A still more efficient protection is afforded their progeny by the marine and
  estuarine species of <i>Arius</i>,<a id="NtA_680" href="#Nt_680"><sup>[680]</sup></a>
  <i>Galeichthys</i>,<a id="NtA_681" href="#Nt_681"><sup>[681]</sup></a> and <i>Osteogeniosus</i>,<a
  id="NtA_682" href="#Nt_682"><sup>[682]</sup></a> the male, more rarely the female, carrying the
  eggs in the mouth and pharynx; these eggs, few in number, are remarkably large, measuring as much
  as 17 or 18 millimetres in diameter in <i>Arius commersonii</i>, a Fish of three or four feet in
  length. According to Babuchin, <i>Malopterurus</i> also is said by the Nile fishermen to shelter
  its fry in the mouth.</p>

  <p>Some of the Silurids attain to a very large size. Among these is the type of the family,
  <i>Silurus glanis</i>, the "Wels" of the Germans, its only European representative, which occurs
  over a great part of Europe, but is absent from the British Isles, France, the Spanish Peninsula,
  and Italy. It is most abundant in the Danube basin, where it sometimes reaches a length of 10 feet
  or more and a weight of 400 lbs. It is the largest strictly fresh-water Fish of Europe. Among the
  smallest species, we have to mention the "Candiru" of Brazil, <i>Vandellia cirrhosa</i>, 60
  millimetres in length and 3 or 4 in diameter, which is believed to enter and ascend the urethra of
  people bathing, being attracted by the urine; the Fish, having once made its way into the urethra,
  cannot be pulled out again, owing to the erectile spines which arm its gill-covers. The natives of
  some parts of the Amazons are in great dread of this Fish, and protect themselves when entering
  the water by wearing a sheath formed of a small, minutely-perforated cocoanut-shell suspended from
  a belt of palm-fibres.<a id="NtA_683" href="#Nt_683"><sup>[683]</sup></a> According <span
  class="pagenum" id="page594"><span class="smaller">{594}</span></span>to Reinhardt<a id="NtA_684"
  href="#Nt_684"><sup>[684]</sup></a> the allied <i>Stegophilus insidiosus</i>, a small colourless
  Fish, 30 to 40 mm. long, from Brazil and Argentine, lives parasitically in the gill-cavity of
  large Cat-Fishes (<i>Platystoma</i>). Dr. F. Silvestri has noticed that it sucks the blood in the
  gills of <i>Platystoma coruscans</i>, a Silurid growing to a length of 6 feet.</p>

  absence of the transverse processes in the praecaudal vertebrae, which have bifid neural spines.
  The air-bladder is always much reduced, and enclosed in a right and a left bony capsule formed by
  the skull and the anterior vertebrae. Gill-openings narrow clefts. The mouth is inferior, with
  more or less developed circular lips and feeble dentition; it is used as a sucker, by which the
  Fish fixes itself to any hard object with such strength that it cannot be pulled off without great
  difficulty. The teeth are usually slender and bicuspid. The food consists of very small prey and
  more or less putrefied organic substances, the intestine being usually extremely elongate and much
  convoluted. The habits of these Fish are very little known, but the fact that the males of many
  species have the pectoral fins much stronger than the females renders it probable that they pair

  and water during eruptions, a story that has been repeated by Humboldt. The fact is that they live
  in small torrents at great altitudes (up to 10,700 feet), and are swept down during periods of
  disturbance caused by the eruption of the volcano.<a id="NtA_686"
  href="#Nt_686"><sup>[686]</sup></a> The members of the sub-family Loricariinae vary much in the

  the breeding season, and the eggs, after being deposited, become attached to the lower surface of
  the head, belly, and paired fins, forming a single layer; each egg becomes connected with the skin

  <p>Eel-shaped Fishes without paired fins, with the pectoral arch free or suspended from the skull,
  and with the anterior vertebrae distinct, without Weberian ossicles. Gill-openings confluent into
  a single, ventral slit. Air-bladder absent.</p>

  <p>The structure of the skull conforms to that of typical Malacopterygians. The praemaxillary and
  maxillary are well developed, the latter placed behind the former, and forming but a very small
  part of the oral border; the symplectic is present; the parietals form a long sagittal suture, and
  separate the frontals from the supraoccipital. The vertebrae are very numerous, the praecaudal
  bearing very strong parapophyses, to which short, slender ribs are attached. The skin is naked
  (Symbranchidae) or covered with minute scales (Amphipnoidae), and the vertical fins are
  rudimentary, reduced to mere dermal folds.</p>

  <p>Like the Apodes, which they resemble in general appearance, these Fishes are no doubt derived
  from some low type with abdominal ventral fins, but whether from the Malacopterygii or the Haplomi
  we have as yet no data from which to conclude. Only two families are known.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Symbranchidae.</b>&mdash;Post-temporal well developed, forked, attached to the

  Tasmania. Although the South American <i>Symbranchus</i> has been observed to live in marshes
  which periodically dry up, the Fish burying itself in the mud like a <i>Lepidosiren</i>, the
  branchiae are fully developed on the four branchial arches. In <i>Monopterus</i>, of similar

  from the skull. The Cuchia, <i>Amphipnous cuchia</i>, the sole representative of this family, an
  inhabitant of the fresh and brackish waters of India and Burma, growing to two feet in length, is
  remarkable for the presence of a respiratory air-sac on each side of the neck behind the head,
  communicating with the gill-cavity. Of the three branchial arches the second alone possesses
  gill-filaments; the third supports, in their place, a thick and semi-transparent tissue; the
  principal organs of respiration are two small bladders, resembling the posterior portions of the
  lungs of snakes, which the animal has the power <span class="pagenum" id="page599"><span
  class="smaller">{599}</span></span>of filling with air immediately derived from the atmosphere.
  Although covered over by the common integuments, these bladders present externally, when inflated,
  two protuberances of a round shape. Of the whole volume of blood contained in the branchial
  artery, one-third passes through the gills and respiratory bladders, whilst the other two-thirds
  are conveyed directly from the heart to the aorta without being exposed to the action of the
  air.<a id="NtA_688" href="#Nt_688"><sup>[688]</sup></a> This amphibious Fish, when in the water,
  constantly rises to the surface for the purpose of respiration, and it is often found lying in the

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order 4. Apodes.</b></p>

  <p>Air-bladder, if present, communicating with the digestive tract by a duct. Praemaxillaries
  absent; the maxillaries, if present, separated on the median line by the coalesced ethmoid and
  vomer. Pectoral arch, if present, not connected with and remote from the skull; mesocoracoid arch
  absent. Fins without spines, the ventrals absent. Anterior vertebrae distinct, without Weberian
  ossicles.</p>

  <p>The Apodes or Eels are elongate, serpentiform Fishes with naked skin, or with minute scales
  imbedded in the skin, the opercular bones small and completely hidden under the integument; narrow
  or minute gill-openings; the vertical fins, if present, confluent behind or separated by the
  projecting tip of the tail. The pterygo-palatine arch is often reduced or absent, and there is no
  distinct symplectic; the supraoccipital bone is small, separated from the frontals by the
  parietals, which meet on the middle line. The vertebrae are very numerous (up to 225), and the
  praecaudals bear strong parapophyses, to which short, slender ribs may be attached; epineurals are
  sometimes present. The five families into which this sub-order is divided show remarkable degrees
  of simplification of the skull, through reduction or loss of either the maxillary or the
  pterygo-palatine arches.</p>

  <p>There has been much difference of opinion in the determination of the bones of the upper jaw in
  these Fishes. Cuvier regarded the lateral bones of the upper jaw as praemaxillaries, Owen and
  Richardson as palatines (at least in Muraenas), whilst Peters <span class="pagenum"
  id="page600"><span class="smaller">{600}</span></span>and most recent authors have identified them
  throughout the order as maxillaries.<a id="NtA_689" href="#Nt_689"><sup>[689]</sup></a> The
  conclusion I have come to from the examination of numerous skulls belonging to various genera, is
  that the praemaxillaries have disappeared in all, whilst the maxillaries have persisted in the
  true Eels (Anguillidae) and disappeared in the Muraenidae, their place being taken by the fused
  palato-ectopterygoids, which may even join the mandibular suspensorium. The vestigial bone,
  regarded by Jacoby as the pterygoid in <i>Muraena helena</i>, may be identified as the
  meta-pterygoid, and therefore does not disprove the homology, here suggested, of the other
  elements of the palate.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Anguillidae.</b>&mdash;Maxillaries present, separated on the median line by the
  ethmo-vomer; palato-pterygoid bone present, connected with the hyomandibular and quadrate;
  gill-clefts separate, opening into the pharynx by wide slits; tongue present; vent far removed

  <p>Spread over all the seas of the temperate and tropical zones, often descending to the greatest
  depths, a few entering fresh waters. Many are known to undergo very striking metamorphoses, the
  pellucid, strongly compressed larvae (<i>Leptocephalus</i>) having long been a puzzle to
  naturalists.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page601"><span class="smaller">{601}</span></span></div>

  <p>Nearly 150 recent species are known, of which some 50 are deep-sea forms, occurring down to
  2500 fathoms. Scanty fossil remains, referable to recent genera or scarcely different from them,
  are known from the Eocene of Europe. The Cretaceous genus <i>Urenchelys</i>, from England and the
  Lebanon, is interesting as representing a more generalised type, the hindmost vertebrae bearing a
  pair of expanded hypural bones, showing the diphycercal Eels to have been derived from Fishes with
  a normal caudal fin.</p>

  <p>The genera are numerous. The following are the principal:&mdash;<i>Anguilla</i>,
  <i>Simenchelys</i>, <i>Ilyophis</i>, <i>Conger</i>, <i>Coloconger</i>, <i>Congromuraena</i>,
  <i>Uroconger</i>, <i>Heteroconger</i>, <i>Muraenesox</i>, <i>Nettastoma</i>,
  <i>Nettophichthys</i>, <i>Saurenchelys</i>, <i>Nettenchelys</i>, <i>Myrus</i>, <i>Myrophis</i>,
  <i>Derichthys</i>, <i>Chilorhinus</i>, <i>Muraenichthys</i>, <i>Liuranus</i>, <i>Ophichthys</i>,
  <i>Moringua</i>.</p>

  <p>In the first four genera, small, more or less lineal rudimentary scales are embedded in the
  skin, arranged in small groups, which are placed obliquely at right angles to one another, forming
  a curious pattern; but these scales are so small that they escape the notice of the superficial
  observer, hence Eels have been improperly included among the Fishes forbidden as food by the
  Mosaic prescriptions. In the other genera, including the exclusively marine Conger of our coasts,
  scales are really absent.</p>

  <p>The Common Eel (<i>Anguilla vulgaris</i>) has a very wide distribution, being found over the
  greater part of Europe, North Africa, Temperate Asia, and perhaps also North America east of the
  Rocky Mountains, Mexico, and the West Indies. Its record from Australia and New Zealand is
  probably due to the imperfection of our knowledge of the specific characters. It is not found in
  the Black Sea nor in the rivers flowing into it, owing, no doubt, to the sulphurous nature of the
  bottom of the sea, to which, as we now know, these Fish would have to resort for breeding.</p>

  <p>The mode of propagation of the Eel long remained a mystery, from the fact that individuals
  found in fresh water never show ripe genital glands. The idea had been entertained of their being
  hermaphrodite, and internal parasites had also given rise to the belief in their viviparous
  nature. The genital glands of the female were first investigated by Rathke in 1838, but it was not
  until 1874 that those of the male were discovered by Syrski, and shortly after fully described by
  L. Jacoby, who, in his final contribution to the subject, concluded that Eels need salt water for
  the development of their organs of generation, and that this development takes place, not near the
  coast, but further out in deep water.</p>

      brevirostris</i> of Kaup. (After Kaup.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>As a rule it is not until the fifth or sixth year that the Eels go to the sea for the purpose
  of propagation, which takes place at great depths&mdash;at least 200 fathoms. Males have been
  observed to precede the females. The breeding season over, the Eels do not return to fresh waters,
  but are believed to die soon after. The eggs were discovered by Raffaele in 1888 in the Gulf of
  Naples, and shortly after Grassi and Calandruccio finally settled the question of the breeding and
  development of the Fish from observations made in the Mediterranean. Their conclusions are thus
  summed up:&mdash;"The Common Eel matures in the depths of the sea, where it acquires larger eyes
  than are ever observed in individuals which have not yet migrated to deep water. The abysses of
  the sea are its spawning places; its eggs float in the sea water. In developing from the egg, it
  undergoes a metamorphosis, it passes through a larval form denominated <i>Leptocephalus
  brevirostris</i>." What length of time the development requires is not yet fully established,
  since the Leptocephali are rarely found at the surface, most of the specimens studied by Grassi
  and Calandruccio having been obtained from the stomach of the Sun-Fish (<i>Orthagoriscus mola</i>)
  in the Straits of Messina; but it is believed that the young Eels or "elvers," which ascend our
  rivers in such prodigious numbers in spring and summer ("Eel-Fares") are already one year old.
  Some individuals apparently spend their whole life in fresh waters, but they are barren.<a
  id="NtA_690" href="#Nt_690"><sup>[690]</sup></a> A specimen was kept in confinement in the family
  of the French naturalist Desmarest for upwards of 40 years, growing to a length of 4&frac12; feet, being
  already of large size at the time of <span class="pagenum" id="page603"><span
  class="smaller">{603}</span></span>its capture. Eels are extremely voracious, and endowed with an
  extraordinary tenacity of life; they can live for many hours out of the water, and are often met
  with at night creeping through the grass of meadows from one pond or stream to another.</p>

  <p>One of the most remarkable among the deep-sea Eels is the Snub-nosed Eel (<i>Simenchelys
  parasiticus</i>), which has been found in great numbers off Newfoundland and the Azores, at depths
  of 200 to 900 fathoms. The maxillary and mandibular bones are very short and massive, provided
  with large obtuse teeth; the head is short and bulldog-like in aspect, the mouth small and
  bordered by a thick circular lip. Some specimens have been observed to burrow in the muscles of
  living Halibut and other large Fishes, after the manner of <i>Myxine</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Nemichthyidae.</b>&mdash;Distinguished from the preceding by the position of the
  vent, which is close to, or at no great distance from, the gill-openings. The rays of the vertical
  fins are connected by thin membrane instead of being imbedded in thick skin, as in most Eels; in
  some of the genera the jaws are excessively prolonged, needle-like, sometimes recurved. Deep-sea
  Eels of small size, represented in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans by about 10 species,
  referred to 6 genera: <i>Dysomma</i>, <i>Dysommatopsis</i>, <i>Nemichthys</i>, <i>Spinivomer</i>,
  <i>Serrivomer</i>, <i>Gavialiceps</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Synaphobranchidae.</b>&mdash;Maxillaries narrowly separated on the median line,
  their extremity strongly attached by ligament to the mandible; pterygo-palatine arch absent.
  Gill-openings externally confluent into a single ventral slit. Deep-sea Fishes, resembling the
  true Eels in the general form and in the presence of linear scales placed at right angles, but
  differing in the absence of the pterygo-palatine arch, as in the Saccopharyngidae. Eight species
  of <i>Synaphobranchus</i> are known, from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, at depths of
  200 to 2000 fathoms.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Saccopharyngidae.</b>&mdash;Maxillaries narrowly separated on the median line,
  extremely elongate; mouth enormous; pterygo-palatine arch absent; hyomandibular arch slender and
  movably articulated to the cranium, the two bones (hyomandibular and quadrate) of which it is
  composed being capable of being swung in all directions; branchial arches far behind the skull; no
  branchiostegal rays or pharyngeal bones.</p>

  <p>Extraordinary-looking deep-sea Fishes allied to the Eels, of which they appear to be a further
  degraded type, the muscles <span class="pagenum" id="page604"><span
  class="smaller">{604}</span></span>being feebly developed and the skeleton imperfectly calcified.
  The mouth, furnished with rather long but feeble, or even minute teeth, and the pharynx and
  stomach are capable of great distension, these Fish being able to get outside a prey very much
  larger than themselves; the eyes are situated far forward on the head; the tail is extremely
  slender and elongate. Four genera are known, each with a single species, from the Atlantic:
  <i>Saccopharynx</i>, <i>Eurypharynx</i>, <i>Macropharynx</i>, and <i>Gastrostomus</i>. The depths
  at which they have been obtained vary between 389 and 1467 fathoms, but three out of the four
  known specimens of <i>Saccopharynx</i> were brought to the surface by having swallowed a Fish too
  large for the capacity of the stomach. The length of the largest specimen is about 6 feet, of
  which the tail constitutes nearly three-fourths.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Voracious marine Fishes, inhabiting tropical and subtropical waters, being
  especially abundant about coral reefs. Some 120 species are known, many reaching a very large
  size, and being also remarkable for their variegated coloration. The genera are mostly founded on
  the dentition, which shows much diversity; the following are the
  principal:&mdash;<i>Myroconger</i>, <i>Enchelycore</i>, <i>Muraena</i>, <i>Thyrsoidea</i>,
  <i>Lycodontis</i>, <i>Pythonichthys</i>, <i>Echidna</i>, <i>Channomuraena</i>. The Muraena of the
  ancient Romans, <i>Muraena helena</i>, of the Mediterranean, Eastern Atlantic, and neighbouring
  parts of the Indian Ocean, occurring exceptionally as far north as the English coast, grows to 4
  feet, and its flesh was more esteemed than that of any other Fish, large numbers being reared in
  specially constructed reservoirs near the sea, and fed on the corpses of slaves. <i>Channomuraena
  vittata</i>, from the coast of Cuba, is known to attain a length of 8 feet, and <i>Thyrsoidea
  macrura</i>, from the Indian Ocean and the Malay Archipelago, to upwards of 10 feet.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order 5. Haplomi.</b></p>

  <p>Air-bladder, if present, communicating with the digestive tract by a duct. Opercle well
  developed. Pectoral arch suspended from the skull; no mesocoracoid arch. Fins usually without,
  rarely with a few spines; ventrals abdominal, if present. Anterior vertebrae distinct, without
  Weberian ossicles.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The absence of the mesocoracoid arch distinguishes the Haplomi from the
  Malacopterygii, with which they are united by various authors. They lead to the Percesoces through
  the Cyprinodontids, and to the Lower Acanthopterygians, such as the Berycidae, through the
  Scopelids, Stephanoberycids, and Percopsids, as is evidenced by the structure of the mouth and the
  forward position, in some of the genera, of the ventral fins, which, however, are never attached
  to the pectoral girdle. Most of the forms which are here included inhabit either fresh water or
  the deep sea.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 367.</span>&mdash;Distribution of the Galaxiidae.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The genus <i>Galaxias</i> has an interesting distribution, the species of which it is made up
  occurring in the fresh waters of the southern hemisphere, viz. 8 in New Zealand and neighbouring
  islands, 7 in New South Wales, 3 or 4 in South Australia, 1 in West Australia, 2 in Tasmania, 7 in
  South America, from Chili southwards, and 1 at the Cape of Good Hope. One species (<i>G.
  attenuatus</i>) is even believed to be identical in New Zealand, Tasmania, South Australia, the
  Falkland Islands, and South America. This conclusion is probably correct from the fact, which may
  account for the distribution of the whole genus, <span class="pagenum" id="page608"><span
  class="smaller">{608}</span></span>that it is not confined to fresh waters, but occurs also in the
  sea. Specimens were observed by Mr. Rupert Vallentin in the Falkland Islands, where the Fish is
  known to the inhabitants as "Smelts," in shoals in the shallow water along the shore; and,
  according to Mr. F. E. Clarke, the same species, in New Zealand, periodically descends to the sea,
  where it spawns, from January to March, and returns from March to May. A marine species has
  recently been discovered at the Chatham Islands. In New Zealand, the <i>Galaxias</i> were called
  "Trout" by the settlers before the introduction of Salmonids, whilst the fry of <i>G.
  attenuatus</i> are eaten as "Whitebait." The largest species reach the length of a foot.
  <i>Neochanna</i>, from New Zealand, differs from Galaxias in the absence of ventral fins; it has
  been found in burrows, which it excavates at a distance from water.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Haplochitonidae.</b>&mdash;Small fresh-water Trout-like Fishes, agreeing in most
  respects with the Galaxiidae, to which they are unquestionably closely related, differing only in
  the greater extent of the praemaxillaries, which exclude the maxillary from the oral border, in
  the double basis cranii (the prootics uniting under the brain, leaving a canal between them and
  the parasphenoid), in the shorter parapophyses, which, like the neural arches of the praecaudal
  vertebrae, are autogenous, and in the presence of a small adipose dorsal fin, opposed to the
  anal.</p>

  <p>Two genera: <i>Haplochiton</i>, naked, with a single species from Chili, the southern extremity
  of South America, and the Falkland Islands, and <i>Prototroctes</i>, covered with small scales, of
  which one species inhabits Queensland, another South Australia, and a third New Zealand. In
  <i>Haplochiton</i>, the urogenital orifice of both sexes is produced into a cylindrical tube,
  which lies concealed in a groove in front of the anal fin.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Enchodontidae.</b>&mdash;Margin of the upper jaw formed by the praemaxillaries and
  the maxillaries, the latter sometimes toothed like the former. Frontals in contact with the
  supraoccipital; basis cranii simple. Ribs sessile; praecaudal vertebrae without transverse
  processes. Rayed dorsal fin never much extended; sometimes an adipose fin behind it. Scales
  delicate or absent, but occasional longitudinal series of scutes occur, the dorsal series, when
  present, being unpaired.</p>

  <p>Cretaceous Fishes allied to, and apparently more generalised than, the Esocidae and Scopelidae.
  Numerous remains from <span class="pagenum" id="page609"><span
  class="smaller">{609}</span></span>Europe and North America, referred to 7 genera:
  <i>Enchodus</i>, <i>Eurypholis</i>, <i>Palaeolycus</i>, <i>Halec</i>, <i>Cimolichthys</i>,
  <i>Prionolepis</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Esocidae.</b>&mdash;Margin of the upper jaw formed by the praemaxillaries and
  maxillaries, the latter behind the former, and toothless. Supraoccipital in contact with the
  frontals, separating the small parietals; opercular bones all well developed; basis cranii simple.
  No parapophyses, except to the hindermost praecaudal vertebrae; epipleurals and epineurals.
  Post-temporal forked, the upper branch attached to the epiotic, the lower to the exoccipital;
  post-clavicle present. Vertical fins far back; no adipose dorsal fin. Pectoral fins inserted very
  low down; ventrals with 6 to 11 rays. Air-bladder present.</p>

  <p>As in the Haplochitonidae, the neural and haemal arches are bones distinct from the centra, and

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A small family of carnivorous freshwater Fishes, including the Pike (<i>Esox</i>), of
  predaceous habits, unsurpassed in greediness and voracity, and the small and insignificant-looking
  <i>Umbra</i>, distinguished by the more anterior position of the dorsal fin, the larger scales,
  and the moderately large gape, with feeble villiform teeth. The range of the Esocidae is
  restricted to the cold and temperate parts of the northern hemisphere. Besides the well-known
  <i>Esox lucius</i> of Europe, Northern Asia, and the northern parts of North America, growing to a
  length of 4 feet, and the Maskinongy (<i>E. nobilior</i>) of north-eastern North America, reaching
  twice that length, the first genus comprises three smaller species from the Eastern United States.
  Remains of <i>Esox</i> have been found in <span class="pagenum" id="page610"><span
  class="smaller">{610}</span></span>various freshwater deposits in Europe as far back as the
  Oligocene. <i>E. lepidotus</i>, of which very perfect specimens have been found in the Upper
  Miocene beds of Oeningen in Baden, differs from the living species in its much larger scales and
  in the greater approximation of the ventral and anal fins, two characters in which it approaches
  <i>Umbra</i>. Only two species of the latter are known: <i>U. crameri</i> ("Hundsfisch"), from the
  stagnant waters of Austria-Hungary, and <i>U. limi</i> ("Mud-Fish"), living in swamps and ditches
  in Canada and the north-eastern United States, often remaining imbedded in the mud of prairie

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Dalliidae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Dallia</i>, with a single species inhabiting the
  streams and ponds of Alaska and Siberia, is related to <i>Umbra</i>, but differs in the very thin
  and papery skeleton, with the post-temporal imperfectly ossified and the pectoral fin without
  pterygials or actinosts. The dorsal fin is far back and opposite to the anal, as in the Pike. The
  ventral fins are composed of three rays only, and the pectorals, which have a somewhat fleshy
  base, have as many as 36. The scales are extremely small, and partly imbedded in the skin. The
  Black-Fish, <i>D. pectoralis</i>, abounds in Sphagnum ponds, feeding on plants and worms, and
  forming the chief food of the natives of some parts of Northern Alaska, where, with the exception
  of the Salmonids, it is the only freshwater Fish. Turner, its discoverer, says its vitality is
  <span class="pagenum" id="page611"><span class="smaller">{611}</span></span>extraordinary:
  Black-Fishes will remain frozen in baskets for weeks, and when thawed are as lively as ever, one
  having been swallowed in a congealed condition by a dog, thawed out by the heat of the stomach,
  and vomited up alive.</p>

  <p>The members of this Family vary much in form, and among them are to be found some of the most
  curious adaptations to bathybial existence. One of the best known is <i>Harpodon nehereus</i>,
  which, when newly taken, is brilliantly phosphorescent all over the body; in a salted and dry
  condition it is the "Bombay-duck," a delicacy eaten with curries, and exported in large quantities
  from the west coast of India. It is not known to occur at any great depth, and is not even
  restricted to the sea, being very abundant in the rivers and estuaries of Bengal and Burma; whilst
  an allied species, <i>H. squamosus</i>, is found in the Indian Ocean at depths of 120 to 300
  fathoms. In <i>Bathypterois</i>, the eyes are very small; some of the rays of the paired fins
  being excessively prolonged, acting as tactile organs, and compensating the reduction in the eyes.
  Sir John Murray has observed about <i>B. longipes</i>: "When taken from the trawl [from 2650
  fathoms] they were always dead, and the long pectoral rays were erected like an arch over the
  head, requiring considerable pressure to make them lie along the side of the body; when erected
  they resembled Pennatulids like <i>Umbellula</i>." In <i>Ipnops</i>, which resembles in general
  form the large-eyed <i>Chlorophthalmus gracilis</i>, the upper surface of the broad spatulate
  snout is occupied by a luminous organ longitudinally divided into two symmetrical halves, and the
  eyes are absent, unless, as first supposed, this extraordinary organ be a modification of them;
  but Professor Moseley's examination seems to have proved beyond doubt that it is a special form of
  phosphorescent organ, the object of which would be to attract other creatures to the wide gape of
  a Fish which, living in the abysses of the sea and deprived of organs of sight and touch, would
  have great difficulty in procuring its food. <i>Odontostomus</i>, with a very large eye which can
  be turned upwards and sidewards, and enormous compressed curved teeth, barbed at the tip and
  depressible backwards, is one of the few Scopelids in which scales are completely absent.</p>

  <p>The numerous species (about 50) of <i>Scopelus</i> and their allies are moderate-sized or small
  pelagic and deep-sea forms found in nearly all the seas, some coming to the surface at night,
  whilst others are confined to great depths; they are remarkable for the series of phosphorescent
  spots (photophores) on the body, and in some species also on the head, where they may form large
  patches on the snout. The arrangement of these photophores is a very <span class="pagenum"
  id="page614"><span class="smaller">{614}</span></span>definite one, and it has been used for the
  division of these Fishes into genera or sub-genera.<a id="NtA_692"
  href="#Nt_692"><sup>[692]</sup></a> The ventral fins have a more forward position than in most
  other members of the Family.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Alepidosauridae.</b>&mdash;Characters as in the preceding, but supratemporal simple,
  attached to the opisthotic, and dorsal fin very long, formed of slender, non-articulated, simple
  or bifid rays, extending along nearly the whole length of the back, followed by a small adipose
  fin. The air-bladder is absent and the body scaleless. The skeleton is feebly ossified; the
  dentition is very powerful, some of the teeth on the palate and mandible being very strongly
  enlarged. 4 or 5 species are known, from considerable depths in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans,
  referable to one genus, <i>Alepidosaurus</i> or <i>Plagyodus</i>. <i>A. ferox</i>, from the
  Atlantic, reaches a length of 4 feet.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 8. Cetomimidae.</b>&mdash;The affinities of the recently discovered genera
  <i>Rondeletia</i> and <i>Cetomimus</i>, deep-sea Fishes from the North Atlantic, at depths of 1000
  to 1600 fathoms, are still uncertain, as the skeleton could not be examined; they are probably
  most nearly related to the Scopelidae. The head is enormous, with very wide gape, that of
  <i>Cetomimus</i> being suggestive of that of a Right Whale; the teeth are small and coarsely
  granular; the gill-openings are very wide; the body is more or less compressed and scaleless; the
  dorsal and anal fins are opposed to each other; no adipose dorsal fin. In <i>Rondeletia</i>, the
  eyes are moderately large, and ventral fins, with 5 rays, are present; in <i>Cetomimus</i>, the
  eyes are very small, and ventral fins are absent.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page615"><span class="smaller">{615}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Chirothricidae.</b>&mdash;Praemaxillaries delicate and styliform, completely
  excluding the maxillaries from the upper border of the mouth; jaws with feeble dentition or
  toothless; opercular apparatus complete. Praecaudal vertebrae with robust parapophyses, to which
  ribs are attached. Ventral fins far forwards.</p>

  <p>These Fishes, of which three fossil genera are known from the Cretaceous of Germany and Syria,
  appear to be related to the Scopelidae, from which the strong parapophyses distinguish them.
  <i>Chirothrix</i> is remarkable for its excessively enlarged ventral fins with about 17 rays;
  these fins were taken for the pectorals by the early describers. In <i>Telepholis</i> and
  <i>Exocoetoides</i>, the ventral fins are smaller than the pectorals, and formed of 7 or 8 rays
  only; the dorsal region, in the former, is protected by a covering of small, thin, rounded or
  polygonal dermal scutes, each bearing a median tubercle.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Kneria</i> comprises two species from the fresh waters of tropical Africa, one
  from Angola, the other from East Africa.<a id="NtA_693" href="#Nt_693"><sup>[693]</sup></a> Small
  Loach-like Fishes, two to four inches long, with the upper jaw projecting beyond the mouth, which
  is inferior and transverse; no barbels; gill-membranes entirely grown to the isthmus, the
  gill-opening being a rather narrow vertical slit; dorsal and anal fins short, the former opposite,
  or nearly opposite, to the ventrals; the snout of the male(?) of <i>K. angolensis</i> is described
  as beset with small spine-like excrescences; the intestinal tract makes several convolutions.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 11. Cyprinodontidae.</b>&mdash;Mouth protractile, the maxillaries excluded from the
  oral border; teeth in the jaws and on the pharyngeal bones; pterygo-palatine arch weak or
  rudimentary; opercular bones all well developed. Basis cranii simple. Praecaudal vertebrae with
  strong parapophyses, bearing the ribs; epipleurals inserted on the ribs. Post-temporal forked.
  Ventrals, if present, with 5 to 7 rays. No adipose dorsal fin. Air-bladder sometimes absent.</p>

  <p>From a physiological point of view, this Family may be divided into carnivorous forms, with
  short digestive tract, and phytophagous or limnophagous ones, in which the intestine forms
  numerous coils. To the first division belong the living genera <i>Cyprinodon</i>,
  <i>Characodon</i>, <i>Tellia</i>, <i>Haplochilus</i>, <i>Fundulus</i>, <i>Rivulus</i>,
  <i>Cynolebias</i>, <i>Orestias</i>, <i>Empetrichthys</i>, <i>Jenynsia</i>,
  <i>Pseudoxiphophorus</i>, <i>Belonesox</i>, <i>Gambusia</i>, <i>Anableps</i>, among existing
  forms, and the fossil genera <i>Prolebias</i> (Oligocene and Miocene) and <i>Pachylebias</i>
  (Miocene); to the second, the living genera <i>Poecilia</i>, <i>Mollienesia</i>,
  <i>Platypoecilus</i>, and <i>Girardinus</i>. <i>Procatopus</i>, a near ally of <i>Haplochilus</i>,
  recently discovered in South Cameroon, is remarkable for having the ventral fins inserted far
  forward, below the pectoral fins.</p>

  <p>These are small or very small Fishes,<a id="NtA_694" href="#Nt_694"><sup>[694]</sup></a> only a
  few reaching a length of about a foot, confined to fresh or brackish waters, recognisable
  externally by the flat head with protractile mouth, the usually large scales, and the absence of a
  well-developed lateral <span class="pagenum" id="page617"><span
  class="smaller">{617}</span></span>line. The teeth vary much in shape: cardiform, villiform, or
  compressed, and bi- or tri-cuspid; the palate is either toothless, or teeth are present on the
  vomer. About 200 species are known, mostly from the American continent, only about 30 being known
  from other parts of the world, viz. Southern Europe, Southern Asia and Japan, and Africa. In many
  species the sexes are dissimilar, the female being larger and less brilliantly coloured, with
  smaller fins; the anal fin of the male may be modified into an intromittent organ by means of
  which internal fertilisation takes place, the ova developing in a sort of uterus, which the young
  leave in a more or less advanced stage of growth. The most curious of the Cyprinodontids is the
  genus <i>Anableps</i>, of Central and South America, surface-swimming Fishes, the strongly
  projecting eyes of which are divided by a horizontal band of the conjunctiva into an upper part
  adapted for vision in the air, and a lower for vision in the water, and the pupil is divided into
  two parts by a constriction; the larger species grows to the length of a foot.</p>

  <p>Small ovoviviparous Fishes, closely related to, and evidently derived from, the Cyprinodontids,
  measuring from 1 to 5 inches, inhabiting ditches and small streams, or confined to subterranean
  waters of limestone caves, in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. Six species,
  referable to three genera, are known. In <i>Chologaster</i>, the eyes are well developed and the
  body is coloured. <i>C. cornutus</i> inhabits the lowland streams and swamps of the South Atlantic
  States, from Virginia to Florida; <i>C. agassizii</i> is found in the underground streams of
  Kentucky and Tennessee; and <i>C. papilliferus</i> occurs under stones in the springs of
  south-western Illinois. <i>Amblyopsis</i> and <i>Typhlichthys</i>, which are evidently derived
  from the former, or from forms closely related to it, have the eyes rudimentary and more or less
  concealed under the skin, and the body is colourless. <i>Amblyopsis spelaea</i> is widely
  distributed in the caves east of the Mississippi, <span class="pagenum" id="page619"><span
  class="smaller">{619}</span></span>both north and south of the Ohio River; it is common in the
  River Styx of the Mammoth Cave. <i>Typhlichthys subterraneus</i> is found with the latter species
  in the caves east of the Mississippi, but is confined to the south side of the Ohio River, whilst
  <i>T</i>. (<i>Troglichthys</i>) <i>rosae</i> is found in the caves west of the Mississippi River.
  Of <i>Amblyopsis spelaea</i>, the late Professor Cope has observed: "If these Amblyopses be not
  alarmed, they come to the surface to feed, and swim in full sight, like white aquatic ghosts. They
  are then easily taken by the hand or net, if perfect silence is preserved, for they are
  unconscious of the presence of an enemy except through the medium of hearing; this sense, however,
  is evidently very acute, for at any noise they turn suddenly downwards, and hide beneath stones,
  etc., on the bottom." Dr. Garman thinks, on the contrary, that such a sense can hardly be
  developed in recesses where we are accustomed to think any sounds other than those made by the
  rippling or dripping water are almost unknown, and that it is through the sense of touch, and not
  through hearing, that the Fish is disturbed. In fact, the head is provided with a great number of
  tactile papillae, arranged in transverse ridges, provided with nervous filaments, which evidently
  compensate the loss of the visual organ.<a id="NtA_695" href="#Nt_695"><sup>[695]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 13. Stephanoberycidae.</b>&mdash;This Family has hitherto been placed near the
  Berycidae, among the Acanthopterygii, but there are no spinous rays in the dorsal and anal fins;
  and the ventrals, formed of one simple and four or five branched rays, are abdominal. The genus
  <i>Stephanoberyx</i>, with two species from the Atlantic, at depths of 535 to 2949 fathoms, is
  characterised by a large, thick, cavernous head, with thin bony spine-bearing ridges, a large
  mouth bordered by the protractile praemaxillaries, behind which are the large maxillaries, a short
  dorsal and a short anal, opposed to each other behind the ventrals, and the body covered with
  feebly imbricated scales, each bearing in the centre one or several erect spines. The largest
  specimen measures 6 inches. <i>Malacosarcus</i>, a small Fish from the Pacific, at depths of 2350
  and 2425 fathoms, is very closely allied to <i>Stephanoberyx</i>, but its scales are very thin and
  cycloid. The striking resemblance which the head <span class="pagenum" id="page620"><span
  class="smaller">{620}</span></span>bears to that of the Berycid <i>Melamphaes</i> may be merely a
  case of convergence, and it must be borne in mind that this appearance is approached by some
  species of <i>Scopelus</i>, with which both <i>Malacosarcus</i> and <i>Melamphaes</i> were
  originally confounded. The praecaudal vertebrae are provided with parapophyses. I have ascertained
  on a specimen of <i>Stephanoberyx monae</i> that the air-bladder is connected with the dorsal side
  of the stomach by a short and comparatively wide duct.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 14. Percopsidae.</b>&mdash;Margin of the upper jaw formed by the praemaxillaries; mouth
  small, not protractile, toothed; palate toothless. Supraoccipital in contact with the frontals,
  separating the small parietals. Basis cranii simple. Most of the praecaudal vertebrae with
  parapophyses, on the upper surface of which the ribs are inserted; no epipleurals. Post-temporal
  forked; post-clavicle present; scapular foramen in the scapula, on which three hour-glass-shaped
  pterygials are inserted, a fourth being inserted on the coracoid. Dorsal fin with two true spines;
  anal with one or two; ventrals far forward, with 9 rays; pectorals inserted rather high. A small
  adipose dorsal fin. Body covered with strongly ctenoid scales. Air-bladder present (with open
  duct).</p>

  <p>This is a most interesting group of Fishes, from the resemblance which they bear to the
  Perches, and they have therefore been raised to the rank of a sub-order, Salmopercae, by Jordan
  and Evermann, who regard them as "archaic fishes, relics of some earlier fauna, and apparently
  derived directly from the extinct transitional forms through which the Haplomi and Acanthopteri
  have descended from allies of the Isospondyli [Malacopterygii]." On the other hand, an analysis of
  their characters shows them to belong to the Haplomi, of which they <span class="pagenum"
  id="page621"><span class="smaller">{621}</span></span>may be regarded as highly specialised
  members, having evolved in the direction of the Acanthopterygii.</p>

  <p>Only two genera are known, each with a single species: <i>Percopsis</i>, from the rivers and
  streams of Canada and the north-eastern United States, and <i>Columbia</i>, more recently
  discovered in the sandy or weedy lagoons along the Columbia River. These Fishes are of small size,
  not exceeding 6 inches in length. Their eggs are unusually large.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order 6. Heteromi.</b></p>

  <p>Air-bladder without open duct. Opercle well developed; parietal bones separating the frontals
  from the supraoccipital. Pectoral arch suspended from the supraoccipital or the epiotic, the
  post-temporal small and simple or replaced by a ligament; no mesocoracoid. Ventral fins abdominal,
  if present.</p>

  <p>The Halosauridae and Notacanthidae are deep-sea Fishes of obscure affinities. In the abdominal
  position of the many-rayed ventral fins and in the absence of the mesocoracoid arch they agree
  with the Haplomi; but if, as the investigations of G&uuml;nther lead us to believe,<a id="NtA_696"
  href="#Nt_696"><sup>[696]</sup></a> there is really no open communication between the air-bladder
  and the digestive tract, they <span class="pagenum" id="page622"><span
  class="smaller">{622}</span></span>should be removed from this physostomous sub-order. The two
  families have many characters in common, such as the attachment and structure of the pectoral
  arch, which is devoid of a post-clavicle, the position of the pectoral fins high up the sides, the
  strong parapophyses inserted very low down on the centra of the vertebrae, the extent of the
  parietal bones, which meet in a sagittal suture and separate the frontals from the supraoccipital.
  The recent discovery of a third family, the Lipogenyidae, which, in the structure of the dorsal
  fin, is exactly intermediate between the two others, has lessened the gap between the Lyomeri
  (Halosauridae) and Heteromi (Notacanthidae) of Gill, which I have proposed to unite in a suborder
  under the latter name.</p>

  <p>These Fishes are no doubt derived from forms in which a separate caudal fin existed; such a
  type must have been near the Dercetidae, as defined by A. S. Woodward, which may provisionally be
  placed here.</p>

  <p>An imperfectly known Fish from the Chalk of Mount Lebanon, <i>Pronotacanthus sahelalmae</i>,
  appears to bear some affinity to <i>Notacanthus</i>, and has been placed in the same family; but
  its characters are not sufficiently defined to refer it without doubt to this division.</p>

  <p>There is a fifth family which may enter this sub-order: the Fierasferidae, the structure of
  which has been exquisitely described and figured by Emery.<a id="NtA_697"
  href="#Nt_697"><sup>[697]</sup></a> Hitherto placed with or near the Ophidiidae, they differ
  widely from them, as well as from all Acanthopterygians, in the conformation of the skull, the
  supraoccipital being separated from the frontals by the parietals, which form a long median
  suture. This is a feature which has only been observed in Fishes with abdominal ventral fins, and
  although the total absence of those fins in <i>Fierasfer</i> deprive us of an important criterion
  in deciding on its affinities, I am inclined to regard this family as derived from an "abdominal"
  type. The conformation of the pectoral arch has much in common with that of the Halosaurs, and,
  notwithstanding the interpretation that has been given to the bones at the back of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page623"><span class="smaller">{623}</span></span>the cranium in the latter
  type, the same may be said, in a general way, of the skull.</p>

  <p class="sp3">As pointed out by Emery, the very anterior position of the vent in the
  Fierasferidae is directly related to the curious mode of life of these Fishes, and the analogous
  condition obtained in various families, such as the Gymnotidae, Nemichthyidae, Amblyopsidae, shows
  it to be a character of relatively small systematic importance.</p>

  apparently forming the greater part of the upper border of the mouth, which is toothed; opercular
  apparatus complete. Dorsal fin more or less extended, without spines; anal short, caudal separate;

  <p><i>Dercetis</i>, <i>Leptotrachelus</i>, <i>Leptecodon</i>, <i>Pelargorhynchus</i>, and
  <i>Stratodus</i>, from the Upper Cretaceous of Europe, Syria, and North America.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Halosauridae.</b>&mdash;Body elongate, covered with cycloid scales, the tail
  tapering to a point, without caudal fin; head with scales; mouth moderate, bordered by the
  praemaxillaries and the maxillaries, both toothed; suborbitals large; praeopercle rudimentary.
  Dorsal fin short, formed of soft rays, above or a little behind the ventrals, which are rather far
  back, and formed of 9 or 10 rays; anal very long, without spines, extending to the end of the
  tail. Ovaries transversely laminated, the ova falling into the abdominal cavity. Some 10 living
  species are known, referred to three genera, inhabiting the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans,
  at depths of 500 to 1400 fathoms.</p>

  <p>In <i>Halosaurus</i> the scales of the lateral line, which runs near the lower profile, are
  scarcely enlarged, and are destitute of luminous organs. <i>Halosaurichthys</i> differs in the
  union of the ventral fins with each other, as in <i>Notacanthus</i>. In <i>Halosauropsis</i> the
  scales of the lateral line are strongly enlarged and pouch-like, and bear photophores.</p>

  <p>This family is one of great antiquity, being represented in the Upper Cretaceous of Westphalia
  by <i>Echidnocephalus</i>, which, as shown by A. S. Woodward, appears to have been closely related
  to <i>Halosaurus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Fierasferidae.</b>&mdash;Body elongate or extremely attenuate, naked, the tail
  tapering to a point or truncate, without distinct caudal fin; mouth small, inferior, bordered by
  the praemaxillaries; jaws toothed; no suborbitals; praeoperculum well developed. Dorsal and anal
  fins very long, extending to the end of the tail, and formed entirely of soft rays. Ventral fins
  absent. Vent situated immediately behind the gill-opening. Air-bladder with a muscular apparatus
  for dilatation of its anterior part.</p>

  <p>A single genus, <i>Fierasfer</i>, with about 10 species, distributed over nearly all the warm
  and tropical seas, rarely found as far north as the west coast of Ireland. <i>Encheliophis</i>,
  without pectoral fins, is the larval form of <i>Fierasfer</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Fierasfer</i> spends the greater part of its existence in the interior of Holothurians and
  other Echinoderms as well as in bivalve Mollusca. It has been observed to enter Holothurians by
  the posterior or anal aperture, either head first or tail foremost, in the latter case availing
  itself of the suction which takes place alternately with the expulsion of water by that orifice;
  it remains near the anus, from which it projects its head in search of food outside its host. It
  is neither a true parasite nor a commensal or mutualist, in the sense given to these terms by Van
  Beneden, but simply a lodger, "inquilino," as Emery puts it. Semper, however, regards
  <i>Encheliophis vermicularis</i> as a true parasite, feeding on the viscera of the Holothurian in
  which it lives. Putnam has examined eight specimens of a <i>Fierasfer</i> from the Bay of Panama,
  which were obtained alive from pearl oysters, and also one beautifully <span class="pagenum"

  <p class="sp3">Following the suggestions of Kner and Steindachner and Cope to their logical
  conclusion, A. S. Woodward, in his valuable catalogue of the Fossil Fishes in the British Museum,
  has united the Lophobranchs of Cuvier with the Hemibranchs of Cope, a course which seems fully
  justified, and has received <span class="pagenum" id="page627"><span
  class="smaller">{627}</span></span>further support from the recent investigations of Swinnerton,<a
  id="NtA_698" href="#Nt_698"><sup>[698]</sup></a> who has proposed to unite the two groups under
  the new name of Thoracostei. The name Phthinobranchii has also been suggested by O. P. Hay for the
  same association. The structure of the Lophobranchs (Solenostomidae and Syngnathidae) shows that
  these fishes are only extremely specialised forms of the group of which the Sticklebacks are the
  well-known type, and the character of the "tufted" gills alone is surely not of sufficiently great
  importance to warrant the retention of the Lophobranchii as a division equivalent to the
  sub-orders adopted in the present classification. Besides, as recently pointed out by A. Huot,<a
  id="NtA_699" href="#Nt_699"><sup>[699]</sup></a> there is no fundamental difference, but only one
  of degree, between the so-called tufted gill and the normal type; each "tuft" corresponds to one
  branchial lamella, and at a certain stage of development the disposition of the branchial lamella
  is the same in a <i>Syngnathus</i> and in an ordinary Teleostean. I have recently attempted to
  show<a id="NtA_700" href="#Nt_700"><sup>[700]</sup></a> that the Lamprididae are related to the
  Hemibranchii, although sufficiently distinct to warrant the establishment of a division, named
  Selenichthyes.<a id="NtA_701" href="#Nt_701"><sup>[701]</sup></a></p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Lamprididae.</b>&mdash;Body short and deep, with minute scales. Snout short; mouth
  toothless, bordered by the praemaxillaries and, to a small extent, by the maxillaries; opercular
  bones well developed. Gills four, pectinated; branchial apparatus fully developed. Post-temporal
  bone forked. Vertebrae very numerous (21 + 25), without transverse processes; ribs strong, long.
  Fins without spines; dorsal and anal elongate. Pectoral fins with very short pterygials folding
  downwards against the body. Pelvic bones connected with the coracoids, which are very large, and
  do not form a suture at their ventral extremity. Ventral fins with 15 to 17 rays.</p>

  <p>The Opah or King-Fish (<i>Lampris luna</i>), the sole representative of this family, is
  remarkable for its large size (growing to a length of four feet) and its vivid colours. Its flesh
  is rich, and intermediate between that of the Salmon and that of the Tunny. It is a pelagic fish
  of wide distribution, known from the North <span class="pagenum" id="page629"><span
  class="smaller">{629}</span></span>Atlantic and Mediterranean and from distant points in the
  Pacific; specimens are occasionally captured on our coasts. It feeds on other fish, but little is
  known of its habits and nothing of its development.</p>

  <p>The affinities of the <i>Lamprididae</i> are very doubtful. <i>Lampris</i> has usually been
  placed with the Acanthopterygians, a view which is still upheld by Gill.<a id="NtA_702"
  href="#Nt_702"><sup>[702]</sup></a> I now agree with this high authority in regarding the bone
  which I took for an infraclavicle as a much developed coracoid, and the bone termed by me the
  coracoid as a pterygial. But it has also been shown, by Starks, that such a thing as an
  infraclavicle does not exist in the Stickleback, the bone so-called being only a part of the
  coracoid; and as in most of the Sticklebacks the pelvic bones join the latter, the resemblance
  between them and <i>Lampris</i> remains. As I have previously pointed out, the absence of spines
  in the fins, and the position of the ventral fins, together with the great number of rays in the
  latter, which is only met with in the lower Teleosteans, are characters which necessitate the
  removal of <i>Lampris</i> from the Acanthopterygians, and I cannot find a better place for them
  than near the Gastrosteidae.</p>

  <p>The whole question of the arrangement of the Physoclists with abdominal ventrals (Catosteomi
  and Percesoces) is, I feel, much in need of revision, and it may be found advisable to break up
  this group into a greater number of sub-orders, in which case the Selenichthyes would stand by
  themselves; the Hemibranchii and Lophobranchii would be united under the former name, as proposed
  by Woodward, or under that of Thoracostei (Swinnerton) or Phthinobranchii (Hay). The position in
  the system of the Pegasidae is still somewhat doubtful. This family is regarded by some authors as
  related to the mail-cheeked Acanthopterygians.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Gastrosteidae.</b>&mdash;Body more or less elongate, naked or protected by bony
  shields, tapering to a slender caudal peduncle. Head moderate, with short or elongate and tubiform
  snout; mouth small, terminal, toothed; opercular bones well developed; suborbitals in contact with
  praeoperculum, protecting the cheek. Gills four, pectinated. Praecaudal vertebrae with strong
  transverse processes and slender, free ribs. Spinous dorsal represented by isolated spines.
  Pectoral fins with short <span class="pagenum" id="page630"><span

  </div>

  <p>Four genera: <i>Gastrosteus</i>, <i>Apeltes</i>, <i>Eucalia</i>, <i>Spinachia</i>.</p>

  <p>The little Three-spined and Two-spined Sticklebacks (<i>Gastrosteus aculeatus</i> and <i>G.
  pungitius</i>), which include many varieties that have been regarded as distinct species, are
  among the best known of our British Fishes. They are remarkable for the perfect indifference with
  which they can be transported from fresh into salt water, and <i>vice versa</i>, and for the
  elaborate nests which the males build in fresh or brackish water, and over which they watch with
  the greatest vigilance after the female has deposited her relatively large eggs.<a id="NtA_703"
  href="#Nt_703"><sup>[703]</sup></a> These nests are made of weeds and twigs fastened together by
  threads secreted by the kidneys of the male. The <span class="pagenum" id="page631"><span
  class="smaller">{631}</span></span>larger fifteen-spined Stickleback (<i>Spinachia vulgaris</i>)
  is entirely marine; its nests are to be found on our coasts in sheltered rock-pools, and they are
  made chiefly of sea-weeds and Hydrozoa. Sticklebacks are short-lived, and are believed to breed
  only once.</p>

  <p>The Gastrosteidae are restricted to the northern hemisphere, being more abundant in the higher
  latitudes, extending to Iceland, Greenland, and Bering Straits; the southernmost points of their
  distribution are Algeria in the Old World, and Lower California in the New.<a id="NtA_704"
  href="#Nt_704"><sup>[704]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A very large number of species have been described, but probably only about a dozen deserve to
  stand.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Aulorhynchidae.</b>&mdash;The genera <i>Aulorhynchus</i> and <i>Auliscus</i>, each
  with one species from the Northern Pacific, much resemble <i>Spinachia</i> in outward form and in
  the equal size of the anterior vertebrae, but the snout is still more produced, tubiform, and the
  ventral fins are formed of one spine and four soft rays. The difference which justifies their
  separation as a distinct family resides in the disposition of the ribs, which are flattened and
  ankylosed to the lateral bony shields.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Protosyngnathidae.</b>&mdash;This family appears to be intermediate between the
  Gastrosteidae and the Aulostomatidae, agreeing with the former in possessing slender, free ribs,
  with the latter in having the first vertebrae elongate, though to a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page632"><span class="smaller">{632}</span></span>less degree than in <i>Aulostoma</i>. Its
  only representative is <i>Protosyngnathus sumatrensis</i>, from a Tertiary freshwater formation in
  Sumatra, which has been referred, without adequate grounds, to <i>Aulorhynchus</i> or
  <i>Auliscops</i>.<a id="NtA_705" href="#Nt_705"><sup>[705]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Aulostomatidae.</b>&mdash;Allied to the Aulorhynchidae, differing in the ventral
  fins devoid of spines, formed of 5 or 6 rays, widely removed from the pectoral arch, the very
  elongate, saddle-shaped anterior vertebra formed by the fusion of several, the large
  supratemporals produced backward over the anterior vertebra, the very elongate pterygials of the
  pectoral fin, and the compressed body covered with small ctenoid scales. Ribs are rudimentary or
  absent. No suborbitals. The snout is long, tubiform; the small terminal mouth bears bands of
  minute teeth, and the lower jaw has a small barbel at the symphysis. A single genus,
  <i>Aulostoma</i>, with two species from the Atlantic coasts of tropical America, and two from the
  Eocene and Miocene of Europe. <i>A. coloratum</i> grows to a length of 26 inches.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Fistulariidae.</b>&mdash;Body greatly elongate, naked. First vertebra much elongate,
  formed by the fusion of several; strong transverse processes to the ribs in front and behind,
  those of two vertebrae suturally united; ribs rudimentary or absent. Supratemporal much produced
  posteriorly, extending over the anterior vertebrae; suborbitals absent; snout forming a long tube,
  which terminates in a narrow mouth with minute teeth. Spinous dorsal entirely absent. Pterygials
  of pectoral fin very elongate. Ventral fins very small, with 6 soft rays, inserted far behind the
  pectoral girdle.</p>

  <p>The Flute-mouths, <i>Fistularia</i>, which Dr. G&uuml;nther describes as "gigantic marine
  Sticklebacks living near the shore, from which they are frequently driven into the open sea," are
  represented by three species, from the tropical and subtropical parts of the Atlantic and
  Indo-Pacific. The middle rays of the forked caudal fin are produced into a long filament. The
  largest species, <i>F. tabaccaria</i>, reaches a length of 6 feet. The same genus is represented
  by two species in the Upper Eocene and Oligocene of Europe, and <i>Urosphen</i>, from the Upper
  Eocene, is regarded as allied to it.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page633"><span class="smaller">{633}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Centriscidae.</b>&mdash;Body moderately elongate, partially enclosed in a bony
  armour, which is distinct from the endoskeleton. Anterior vertebrae elongate, with strong
  parapophyses ankylosed to the exoskeleton; no ribs. Suborbitals absent; snout forming a long tube,
  with small, terminal, toothless mouth. Two dorsal fins, the anterior with a very strong spine.
  Pterygials of pectoral fin very small. Ventral fins small, with 4 or 5 rays, the pelvic bones in
  contact with the postclavicles.</p>

  <p><i>Centriscus</i>, with five species in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, represents this family
  at the present day. <i>C. scolopax</i> has occasionally been found on the English coast. Isolated
  spines from the Pliocene of Tuscany have been referred to the same genus. <i>Rhamphosus</i>, from
  the Eocene of Monte Bolca, is believed to have been allied to <i>Centriscus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 8. Amphisilidae.</b>&mdash;Near the preceding, but body extremely compressed and
  completely enclosed in a thin bony armour which is fused with the endoskeleton; the caudal region,
  much abbreviated, is free and relegated to the ventral surface, the body terminating in the two
  dorsals, of which the first bears a strong spine. The ventral fins are far back, very small,
  formed of 3 or 4 rays.</p>

  <p><i>Amphisile</i> is represented by three or four recent species in the Indian and Pacific
  Oceans, and two are known from Upper Eocene and Oligocene beds in Europe. Dr. Arthur Willey has
  observed these fishes in the Southern Pacific. <i>A. strigata</i> "lives in small shoals of about
  half-a-dozen individuals, and swims about with rapidity in a vertical position, cleaving the water
  with its razor-shaped body."</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Solenostomidae.</b>&mdash;Body moderately elongate, with large star-like
  ossifications. Anterior vertebrae elongate, without transverse processes; no ribs. Snout much
  produced, tubiform; mouth, small, terminal, toothless; no praeoperculum; symplectic elongate;
  gill-opening wide; gill-lamellae small rounded lobes. Two short dorsal fins, the rays of the
  anterior not articulated, flexible spines. Pterygials of pectoral fin very small. Ventral fins
  large, with 7 rays, behind the pectoral arch. No air-bladder.</p>

  <p>The unique genus, <i>Solenostomus</i>, with three or four species from the Indian and Pacific

  <i>Syngnathidae</i>. In the female the inner side of the ventral fins coalesces <span
  class="pagenum" id="page634"><span class="smaller">{634}</span></span>with the integuments of the
  body, forming a large pouch for the reception of the eggs.</p>

  <p><i>Solenorhynchus</i>, from the Upper Eocene of North Italy, probably belongs to this family,
  but its form is much more elongate, and the exoskeleton is in regular rings.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 10. Syngnathidae.</b>&mdash;Body more or less elongate, protected by an exoskeleton
  forming rings. Anterior vertebrae not elongate; parapophyses strong, ankylosed to the exoskeleton;
  no ribs. Snout much produced, tubiform; mouth small, terminal, toothless; no praeoperculum;
  symplectic elongate; gill-cleft reduced to a very small opening near the upper posterior angle of
  the gill-cover; gill-lamellae small rounded lobes. A single dorsal fin. Pectoral fins, if present,
  with very small pterygials; ventrals absent. Caudal fin often absent; tail sometimes
  prehensile.</p>

  <p>This family embraces about 175 marine species, and is represented over the greater part of the
  world. Principal genera: <i>Siphonostoma</i>, <i>Syngnathus</i>, <i>Penetopteryx</i>,
  <i>Ichthyocampus</i>, <i>Nannocampus</i>, <i>Osphyolax</i>, <i>Urocampus</i>, <i>Doryichthys</i>,
  <i>Coelonotus</i>, <i>Stigmatophorus</i>, <i>Nerophis</i>, <i>Protocampus</i>,
  <i>Gastrotoceus</i>, <i>Solenognathus</i>, <i>Hippocampus</i>, <i>Acentronura</i>,
  <i>Phyllopteryx</i>.</p>

  <p>Remains are found in the Upper Eocene and Miocene beds of Europe, and have been referred to
  <i>Siphonostoma</i> and <i>Syngnathus</i>, and to the extinct genus <i>Calamostoma</i>. It is
  probable that <i>Pseudosyngnathus</i>, from the Upper Eocene of Monte Bolca, is the type of a
  distinct family.</p>

  <p>The best known members of this family are the Needle-Fish or Pipe-Fish (<i>Siphonostoma</i> and
  <i>Syngnathus</i>) and Sea-Horse (<i>Hippocampus</i>) of our coasts. The latter, like
  <i>Amphisile</i>, swims with the body in a vertical position. In most species the male takes
  charge of the eggs, in a pouch under the tail (<i>Siphonostoma</i>, <span class="pagenum"

  <p>An Australian species of <i>Syngnathus</i> has been described by E. P. Ramsay under the name of
  <i>S. intestinalis</i>, from its living inside Holothurians, in the manner of <i>Fierasfer</i>,
  and G. Lunel has observed a <i>Doryichthys</i> to offer a similar instance of inquilinism.</p>

  <p>One of the most remarkable types of Syngnathids is <i>Phyllopteryx</i>, from Australia. The
  spines and knobs of the head and body are furnished with dermal appendages, which closely imitate
  the fucus among which they live.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 11. Pegasidae.</b>&mdash;Body short or moderately elongate, encased in an exoskeleton
  forming rings. Anterior vertebrae not elongate; no ribs. Snout produced beyond the mouth, which is
  small, inferior, and toothless; no praeoperculum, no symplectic; gill-opening very small; gills
  pectinated. A single dorsal fin. Pectoral fins large, horizontal; ventrals reduced to one or two
  filamentous rays, behind the scapular arch. Air-bladder absent.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page636"><span class="smaller">{636}</span></span></div>

  <p class="sp3">Five or six species, referable to two genera, <i>Pegasus</i> and
  <i>Parapegasus</i>, make up this family. They are very small fishes, inhabiting the coasts of
  China, Japan, Arabia, the Malay Archipelago, and Australia. <i>Pegasus</i> is remarkable among all
  fishes in having the five anterior rays of the pectoral fin transformed into strong spines.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order 8. Percesoces.</b></p>

  <p>Air-bladder, if present, without open duct. Parietal bones separated by the supraoccipitaL
  Pectoral arch suspended from the skull; no mesocoracoid arch. Ventral fins, if present, abdominal,
  or at least with the pelvic bones not solidly attached to the clavicular arch.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This group connects the Haplomi with the Acanthopterygii, the Scombresocidae being
  somewhat related to the Cyprinodonts,<a id="NtA_706" href="#Nt_706"><sup>[706]</sup></a> whilst
  the Anabantidae show distinct affinity to the Osphromenidae in the following sub-order. Other
  families, previously included among the Scombriform Acanthopterygians, are placed here on the
  assumption that the loose attachment of the pelvic bones to the clavicles is a primitive
  character, and not the result of degeneration, such as occurs in some cases among true
  Acanthopterygians. Although this sub-order is perhaps only an artificial association, it must be
  borne in mind that, notwithstanding the very wide divergence which exists between the first and
  last families, and however dissimilar their members may appear to be at first sight, a gradual
  passage may be traced connecting the most aberrant types.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Scombresocidae.</b>&mdash;Maxillary entering the border of the upper jaw; dentition
  moderately strong or feeble. Lower pharyngeal bones united. Praecaudal vertebrae with strong
  parapophyses supporting the ribs. Body covered with cycloid scales. Pectoral fins inserted very
  high up; ventral fins widely separated from the pectorals, without spines, with 6 rays. Dorsal fin
  opposed to the anal, and likewise formed entirely of soft rays. Air-bladder generally present,
  sometimes cellular.</p>

  <p>The shape of the head and body vary greatly, and the pectoral fin may reach an extraordinary
  wing-like development. The dorsal fin may be followed by a series of finlets, as in many of the
  Scombridae. Most of the Scombresocidae, of which about 200 species are known, are marine; some are
  carnivorous, <span class="pagenum" id="page638"><span class="smaller">{638}</span></span>others
  (<i>Hemirhamphus</i>) mainly herbivorous, feeding on green algae. Nearly all are in the habit of
  making great leaps out of the water, this tendency culminating in the Flying-Fish
  (<i>Exocoetus</i>), which skip or sail through the air in a manner the explanation of which has
  given rise to much controversy. According to the latest evidence<a id="NtA_707"
  href="#Nt_707"><sup>[707]</sup></a> the sole source of motive power is the action of the strong
  tail while in the water; no force is acquired while the fish is in the air. The pectorals are not
  used as wings but as parachutes. There is every passage between the small pectoral fin of a Saurie
  (<i>Scombresox</i>) or a <i>Hemirhamphus</i> and the swallow-like wings of the most developed
  <i>Exocoetus</i>. The genus <i>Hemiexocoetus</i> is a very remarkable connecting form. The
  Gar-Pike (<i>Belone</i>), of which one species is common on our coasts, have both jaws produced
  into a long slender beak; the bones are green. In <i>Hemirhamphus</i> the lower jaw only is
  prolonged; some of the species, living in fresh water, are viviparous, the anal fin being modified
  into a copulatory organ, as in many Cyprinodonts.</p>

  <p>Scombresocidae occur in all the tropical and temperate seas. <i>Belone</i>, <i>Scombresox</i>,
  and <i>Hemirhamphus</i> are found in Upper Eocene and Miocene beds of Europe, and, as stated
  above, <i>Protaulopsis</i> should perhaps be referred to this family.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Ammodytidae.</b>&mdash;Maxillary excluded from the border of the upper jaw; mouth
  protractile; dentition feeble or absent. Lower pharyngeal bones separate. Praecaudal vertebrae
  without parapophyses. Body covered with very small cycloid scales. Pectoral fins nearer the
  ventral than the dorsal line; ventral fins, if present, widely separated from the pectorals,
  without spine, with 6 rays. Dorsal and anal fins more or less elongate, formed of soft rays.
  Air-bladder absent.</p>

  <p>The existing genera, <i>Ammodytes</i>, with 8 species, from the temperate coasts of the
  northern hemisphere, and <i>Hypoptychus</i>, from northern Japan, with a single species, are
  deprived of ventral fins, and their exact relations remained obscure until the structure of the
  Oligocene <i>Cobitopsis</i> revealed their affinity to the <i>Scombresocidae</i>, or at least
  their pertinence to the present suborder. The Greater Sand-Eel or Launce (<i>Ammodytes
  lanceolatus</i>) and the Lesser Sand-Eel (<i>A. tobianus</i>) are common on our coasts, and are
  remarkable for the manner in which, by means of their sharp-pointed snout, they bury themselves
  with great rapidity in the sand, darting in and out like arrows.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Atherinidae.</b>&mdash;Maxillary excluded from the border of the upper jaw;
  dentition more or less developed. Body covered with cycloid or ctenoid scales. Ribs attached to

  by a ligament. Two well-separated dorsal fins, the anterior small and formed, at least in part, of
  spinous rays. Air-bladder present.</p>

  <p>Carnivorous Fishes, mostly marine and of small size, much valued as food, and distributed along
  the coasts of most tropical and temperate seas; some inhabit fresh waters. A silvery lateral band,
  or "stole," is usually present. About 65 species are known, referred to 14 genera:
  <i>Atherina</i>, <i>Iso</i>, <i>Chirostoma</i>, <i>Thyrina</i>, <i>Atherinella</i>,
  <i>Labidesthes</i>, <i>Atherinopsis</i>, <i>Atherinops</i>, <i>Telmatherina</i>,

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page640"><span class="smaller">{640}</span></span></div>

  <p>Represented in the Upper Eocene of Europe by several species of <i>Atherina</i> and by the
  extinct genus <i>Rhamphognathus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Mugilidae.</b>&mdash;Maxillary excluded from the border of the upper jaw; dentition
  feeble or absent. Body covered with cycloid scales. Ribs attached to the extremity of strong
  parapophyses. Pectoral fins inserted high up; ventral fins more or less approximated to the
  pectorals, with one spine and five soft rays; pelvic bones suspended from the post-clavicles. Two
  well-separated dorsal fins, the anterior formed of a small number of spines. Air-bladder
  present.</p>

  <p>These Fishes are closely related to the preceding, of which they are a further specialisation,
  the pharyngeal bones having a complicated structure, much reducing the oesophageal opening, and
  the vertebrae being reduced in number (24 to 26 instead of 32 to 60). They feed on organic matter
  contained in mud, and inhabit the fresh waters and coasts of the temperate and tropical regions.
  The species number about 100. Principal genera: <i>Mugil</i>, <i>Myxus</i>, <i>Anostomus</i>,
  <i>Joturus</i>. Grey Mullets (<i>Mugil</i>) are represented on our coasts by three species, valued
  as food, one of which (<i>M. capito</i>) has a remarkably wide range, occurring from Scandinavia
  to the Cape of Good Hope. Remains referred to the same genus occur in the Miocene and

  </div>

  <p>Three closely allied genera: <i>Polynemus</i>, <i>Pentanemus</i>, and <i>Galeoides</i>, with
  about 25 species, from the shores of tropical seas, often entering rivers. Some attain a length of
  4 feet, and are valued as food or for the isinglass yielded by their air-bladder. The free
  pectoral filaments are organs of touch, and can be moved independently of the fins.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Chiasmodontidae.</b>&mdash;The deep-sea genera, <i>Chiasmodon</i>,
  <i>Pseudoscopelus</i>, and <i>Champsodon</i>, which have been placed either with the Gadidae, the
  Trachinidae, or the Berycidae, may be referred to the Percesoces, as the pelvic fins have only a
  ligamentous connexion with the pectoral arch. Unfortunately, the skeleton has only been examined
  in <i>Champsodon</i>; it is remarkably similar to that of the Atherinidae. As in
  <i>Atherinichthys</i>, the posterior extremity of the air-bladder is protected by a bony sheath
  formed by the expanded ring-like haemal processes of the anterior caudal vertebrae. Vertebrae 32
  (16 + 16). The <span class="pagenum" id="page642"><span class="smaller">{642}</span></span>scales
  are absent or very small and spinulose, the mouth large, with cardiform teeth; spinous dorsal
  short, soft dorsal and anal elongate. <i>Chiasmodon</i> and <i>Pseudoscopelus</i> have a
  complicated system of sensory organs on the body, which in the latter suggest the photophores of
  Scopelids. <i>Champsodon vorax</i> is a fish of extreme voracity, swallowing prey much larger than
  itself. Only four species of this family are known.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Sphyraenidae.</b>&mdash;Maxillary excluded from the border of the upper jaw;
  dentition very strong. Body covered with cycloid scales. Anterior ribs sessile, the rest inserted
  on parapophyses. Pectoral fin nearer the ventral than the dorsal outline; ventral fin more or less
  approximated to the pectoral, with 1 spine and 5 soft rays; pelvis not connected with the pectoral
  arch. Two well-separated dorsal fins, the anterior formed of a small number of spines. Air-bladder
  large. Vertebrae 24.</p>

  <p>Carnivorous Pike-like Marine Fishes from the tropical and sub-tropical seas, often found at the
  mouths of rivers. The "Barracudas" form a single genus, <i>Sphyraena</i>, with about 20 species,
  the largest of which grow to 8 feet and are dangerous to people bathing; many are valued as food,
  but some are reported to be poisonous, at least at certain seasons. Remains of several species are
  known from the Eocene and later periods in Europe and North America.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 8. Tetragonuridae.</b>&mdash;Maxillary excluded from the border of the upper jaw;
  dentition feeble. Oesophagus with lateral sacs which are beset with papillae internally; a series
  of gill-raker-like knobs below the pseudobranchiae. Body covered with rhomboidal, striated scales
  in oblique transverse series, those of every single transverse series coherent. Ribs mostly
  sessile. Pectoral fin nearer the ventral than the dorsal outline. Ventral fin with 1 spine and 5
  soft rays, near the pectoral, but pelvis free from the pectoral arch. A long continuous dorsal
  fin, its anterior portion formed of numerous short spines. Air-bladder absent. Vertebrae 58.</p>

  <p>This family includes a single, rather rare fish, <i>Tetragonurus cuvieri</i>, from the
  Mediterranean and neighbouring parts of the Atlantic and the South Pacific. It is said to descend
  to great depths at certain seasons, and to feed on Medusae; its flesh is poisonous. Young
  specimens have been observed by Emery to live in the respiratory cavity of large Salpae.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page643"><span class="smaller">{643}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Stromateidae.</b>&mdash;Although including a number of forms very unlike
  <i>Tetragonurus</i> in external appearance, there is no doubt that this family, hitherto placed
  near the Scombridae, is very closely allied to the preceding, agreeing with it in the presence of
  lateral oesophageal sacs bearing internally papillae (which are besides beset with setiform
  teeth), and, in most genera, in the presence of a series of knobs, more or less similar to
  gill-rakers, below the pseudobranchiae. The pelvic bones are sometimes free from the pectoral
  arch, as in the Tetragonuridae, sometimes more closely attached, but only by ligament, and
  movable. The principal difference resides in the scales, which are always cycloid and usually very
  small and more or less deciduous, and in the spinous dorsal being shorter than the soft, or even
  quite rudimentary. The ventrals are sometimes absent. The air-bladder is present or absent. The
  number of vertebrae varies from 24 to 46.</p>

  <p>Marine Fishes, pelagic or deep-sea, feeding on Crustaceans, Medusae, or the fry of other fish.
  About 45 species are known, referable to 10 genera: <i>Nomeus</i>, <i>Cubiceps</i>, <i>Psenes</i>,
  <i>Seriolella</i>, <i>Psenopsis</i>, <i>Centrolophus</i>, <i>Lirus</i>, <i>Stromateus</i>,
  <i>Peprilus</i>, and <i>Stromateoides</i>. Many of the species have a wide distribution, but are
  rare in collections.<a id="NtA_708" href="#Nt_708"><sup>[708]</sup></a> The Black-Fish
  (<i>Centrolophus niger</i>) and its close ally <i>C. britannicus</i>, and the Rudder-Fish
  (<i>Lirus perciformis</i> and <i>L. medusophagus</i>), have occurred, at rare intervals, on the
  British coasts. The Stromateidae were represented by several species in the Cretaceous
  (<i>Platycormus</i> and <i>Homosoma</i>).</p>

  <p>The widely distributed <i>Nomeus gronovii</i>, so remarkable for its enormous ventral fins,
  folding in a ventral groove, has been observed in New South Wales to be only found on the coast
  when the Siphonophores called "Portuguese Men-of-War" or <i>Physalia</i> are driven ashore, the
  fish swimming beneath them, as the young <i>Caranx</i> are in the habit of doing under Medusae. As
  observed by Waite,<a id="NtA_709" href="#Nt_709"><sup>[709]</sup></a> the benefit of such a
  partnership must primarily be with the fish, for it is a voluntary agent, whereas the
  <i>Physalia</i> has no power of locomotion. "If the fish secures safety from its enemies by
  entering the area embraced by the deadly tentacles of the <i>Physalia</i>, which attain a length
  of 10 to <span class="pagenum" id="page644"><span class="smaller">{644}</span></span>12 feet, it
  must be immune to their influence: a remarkable condition, considering that small fish have often
  been seen in their stomachs and entangled in their tentacles." This observer adds: "It is probable
  that, in addition to protection, the fish derives its food from association with the
  <i>Physalia</i>, much as does the Remora in accompanying a shark. The <i>Physalia</i> doubtless
  paralyses many more animals than it can consume&mdash;the residue falling to the lot of the
  fishes, which may be present to the number of ten."</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 10. Icosteidae.</b>&mdash;The so-called "Rag-Fishes," in which the skeleton is quite
  soft and cartilaginous, are aberrant deep-sea forms evidently related to the Stromateidae; they
  lack the oesophageal teeth and the processes of the last gill-arch, but <i>Icosteus</i> at least
  has the gill-raker-like knobs below the pseudobranchiae. The pelvis is widely separated from the
  clavicles. Spines are absent in the fins, and the body is naked or covered with small cycloid
  scales. Vertebrae in large number (up to 70).</p>

  <p><i>Icosteus</i>, <i>Icichthys</i>, and <i>Acrotus</i>, each with a single species, from the

  <p class="sp3"><b>Fam. 12. Anabantidae.</b>&mdash;Differ from the preceding, to which they are
  closely related, in having part of the dorsal and anal fins and the outer ventral ray spinous, and
  a shorter, Perch-like body covered with ctenoid scales. The accessory superbranchial organ is
  still more developed, with thin bony laminae, which are more or less folded and covered with a
  mucous membrane. These Fishes can live a long time out of water, and the name <i>Anabas
  scandens</i>, or Climbing Perch, recalls the fact that its first observers in India ascribed to it
  the habit of climbing up low trees by means of the spines with which its <span class="pagenum"
  id="page646"><span class="smaller">{646}</span></span>gill-covers and ventral fins are armed. This
  species, which attains a length of 8 inches, is found in estuaries and fresh waters of India,
  Ceylon, Burma, and the Malay Peninsula and Archipelago; 3 other species occur in the Malay
  Archipelago, and 11 in Africa.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order 9. Anacanthini.</b></p>

  <p>Air-bladder without open duct. Parietal bones separated by the supraoccipital; prootic and
  exoccipital separated by the enlarged opisthotic. Pectoral arch suspended from the skull; no
  mesocoracoid arch. Ventral fins below or in front of the pectorals, the pelvic bones posterior to
  the clavicular symphysis and only loosely attached to it by ligament.</p>

  <p>Fins without spines; caudal, if present, without expanded hypural, perfectly symmetrical, and
  supported by the neural and haemal spines of the posterior vertebrae and by basal bones similar to
  those supporting the dorsal and anal rays. This type of caudal fin must be regarded, as I have
  pointed out,<a id="NtA_710" href="#Nt_710"><sup>[710]</sup></a> as secondary, the Gadidae being,
  no doubt, derived from Fishes like the Macruridae, in which the homocercal fin had been lost. The
  scapular foramen or fenestra is nearly always between the scapular and coracoid bones, as in the
  Trachinidae and several allied families, not in the coracoid, as in the other Acanthopterygians.
  The first two vertebrae have no epipleurals.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Macruridae.</b>&mdash;Mouth more or less inferior, protractile; teeth small, none on
  palate. Anterior vertebrae without transverse processes, with the ribs sessile, the rest with
  strong transverse processes supporting the ribs, which themselves bear epipleurals. Gill-membranes
  free from isthmus or narrowly attached; 6 or 7 branchiostegal rays; gills 3&frac12; or 4; pseudobranchiae
  rudimentary or absent. Ventral fins below the pectorals, with 7 to 12 rays. Body short, tail
  elongate and tapering to a point, without caudal fin. A short anterior dorsal, with a single
  simple ray, and a long dorsal and anal meeting together at the end of the tail, formed entirely of
  articulated rays&mdash;the two dorsals sometimes continuous (<i>Lyconus</i>).</p>

  <p>Deep-sea Fishes with very large eyes and small or rather large mouth, usually covered with
  rough spiny scales; a mental barbel is present, except in <i>Lyconus</i>, and the muciferous
  cavities of the skull are strongly developed, the bones being remarkably thin. About 120 species
  are known, some of which have a wide distribution. Macrurids have been found in all the seas where
  deep-sea dredging has been practised&mdash;the greatest depth at which they have been obtained
  being 2650 fathoms. Principal genera: <i>Macrurus</i>, <i>Gadomus</i> (with perforate scapula)
  <i>Coryphaenoides</i>, <i>Hymenocephalus</i>, <i>Malacocephalus</i>, <i>Lionurus</i>,
  <i>Trachyrhynchus</i>, <i>Steindachneria</i>, <i>Bathygadus</i>, <i>Lyconus</i>,
  <i>Macruronus</i>. A larval form of this family has received the name of <i>Krohnius</i>; it is

  rays. Body more or less elongate, covered with small cycloid scales. Dorsal and anal fins
  elongate, formed of articulated rays, sometimes divided into two or three distinct portions.
  Caudal fin more or less distinct, supported by the unmodified or but slightly modified neural and
  haemal spines of the last vertebrae, which are perfectly symmetrical (diphycercal or isocercal
  type).</p>

  <p>A mental barbel is often present, as in the Macruridae, and the suture between the frontal
  bones has disappeared in most of the members of this very natural family. About 120 species are
  distinguished, mostly marine, many being adapted to life at great depths. All are carnivorous.
  They inhabit chiefly the northern seas, but many abyssal forms occur between the tropics and in
  the southern parts of the Atlantic and Pacific. Principal genera: <i>Gadus</i>, <i>Merluccius</i>,
  <i>Holargyreus</i>, <i>Lotella</i>, <i>Physiculus</i>, <i>Phycis</i>, <i>Haloporphyrus</i>,

  <p>Several species, referred to <i>Gadus</i> and <i>Brosmius</i>, have been described from the

  <p>The fishes of this family are among the most important from an economic point of view. It will
  suffice to allude merely by name to the following among the European forms:&mdash;The Cod-Fish
  (<i>Gadus morrhua</i>), the largest species, reaching a length of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page649"><span class="smaller">{649}</span></span>4 feet and a weight of 100 lbs., the Haddock
  (<i>G. aeglefinus</i>), the Whiting (<i>G. merlangus</i>), the Bib or Pout (<i>G. luscus</i>), the
  Pollack (<i>G. pollachius</i>), the Coal-Fish (<i>G. virens</i>), the Hake (<i>Merluccius
  vulgaris</i>), and the Ling (<i>Molva vulgaris</i>). Species of <i>Merluccius</i> occur also on
  the coasts of Chili and of New Zealand. The Rocklings (<i>Onus</i> or <i>Motella</i>) are of small
  size; several species are of common occurrence in our tide-pools. The Burbot (<i>Lota
  vulgaris</i>) is a freshwater fish, exceeding a length of 3 feet, of excellent quality, but
  unfortunately local and rare in this country.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Muraenolepididae.</b>&mdash;Closely related to the Gadidae, from which they differ
  in not having a separate caudal fin, in the gill-openings being narrow and below the base of the
  pectorals, in the increased number (ten) of the pectoral pterygials,<a id="NtA_713"
  href="#Nt_713"><sup>[713]</sup></a> and in the peculiar scales, similar to those of the

  <p>Air-bladder usually without open duct. Opercle well developed; supraoccipital in contact with

  <p class="sp3">The character from which this sub-order, the most comprehensive of the whole class,
  derives its name, viz. the presence of non-articulated, more or less pungent, rays in the dorsal
  and anal fins, is by no means universal, exceptions to the rule being numerous. The mouth is
  usually bordered by the premaxillaries to the exclusion of the maxillaries, and if these should,
  by exception, enter the oral edge, they are always toothless. The ventral fins are sometimes
  inserted at some distance behind the base of the pectorals (<i>Haplodactylidae</i>,
  <i>Platycephalidae</i>), in which case, however, this is due to the elongation of the pelvic
  bones, which are solidly attached to the clavicular arch. The sub-order is broken up into

  <p class="sp3">This large group, consisting chiefly of marine forms, has members in all parts of
  the world, with the exception of the Arctic and Antarctic regions, and was already represented by
  numerous Berycidae and a few Serranidae and Scorpididae in the Upper Cretaceous. The division into
  families is a task of considerable difficulty, and the necessities of a linear arrangement result
  in the breaking up of some natural sequences. Thus it appears highly probable that the
  Scorpididae, themselves derived, together with the Serranidae, from the Berycidae, lead to the
  Carangidae in the division Scombriformes, whilst a nearly perfect passage can be traced between
  the Acanthuridae of this division and the Balistidae among the Plectognaths.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This family is remarkable for the retention of two archaic characters: the large number of rays
  to the ventral fins and the duct between the air-bladder and the digestive tract; the latter
  character is, however, not universal, and has only been found in two genera (<i>Beryx</i> and
  <i>Holocentrum</i>). The scaling of the body varies greatly, and so does the development of the
  spines in the vertical fins. Several genera (<i>Melamphaes</i>, <i>Anoplogaster</i>,
  <i>Trachichthys</i>, etc.) have the head studded with large muciferous cavities which are covered
  with a thin skin. The vent is usually situated far behind the ventral fin, but in
  <i>Paratrachichthys</i>, a genus closely allied to <i>Trachichthys</i>, it occupies a more
  anterior position, between the ventrals, whilst in <i>Aphredoderus</i> it shifts still further
  with age, opening on the throat in the adult.</p>

  <p>The Berycidae were abundantly represented in Cretaceous deposits by <i>Beryx</i> and other
  genera more or less closely related to living forms, and they appear to have been the precursors
  of other Perciform Fishes. About 70 species, referred to 13 genera, are known to live at the
  present day, mostly at great depths, in <span class="pagenum" id="page656"><span
  class="smaller">{656}</span></span>the seas nearly all over the world. But one freshwater form is
  known, <i>Aphredoderus sayanus</i>, the little Pirate Perch of North America, growing to 5 inches
  in length. The largest marine forms (<i>Beryx</i> and <i>Gephyroberyx</i>) measure from 1 to 2
  feet.</p>

  <p>Recent genera: <i>Beryx</i>, <i>Polymixia</i>, <i>Aphredoderus</i>, <i>Melamphaes</i>,
  <i>Plectromus</i>, <i>Scopelogadus</i>, <i>Anoplogaster</i>, <i>Caulolepis</i>,
  <i>Trachichthys</i>, <i>Paratrachichthys</i>, <i>Gephyroberyx</i>, <i>Myripristis</i>,

  <p>Fossil genera: <i>Sphenocephalus</i>, <i>Acrogaster</i>, <i>Pycnosterinx</i>,
  <i>Hoplopteryx</i>, from the Upper Cretaceous. <i>Asineops</i>, from the Eocene of North America,
  is supposed to be allied to <i>Aphredoderus</i>. <i>Beryx</i> is represented by several species in
  the Upper Cretaceous, and <i>Holocentrum</i> occurs in the Eocene and Miocene.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Monocentridae.</b>&mdash;The single genus <i>Monocentris</i>, with two species, one
  from the seas of Japan, China, and India, and one from the South Pacific, is very nearly related
  to the Berycidae, but differs in the absence of ribs on the anterior six vertebrae, in the very
  large bony scales, forming together a coat of mail, and in the structure of the ventral fin, which
  is reduced to a strong spine and two or three very short soft rays. The spines of the dorsal fin
  are very strong and isolated.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Pempheridae.</b>&mdash;The resemblance which the fishes united under this family
  bear to <i>Beryx</i> is very striking, and applies to the skeleton as well as to the external
  characters. But the ventral fins are formed of one spine and five soft rays, as in most
  Acanthopterygians. <i>Bathyclupea</i> agrees with <i>Beryx</i> in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page657"><span class="smaller">{657}</span></span>being possessed of an open duct to the
  air-bladder. About twelve species are known, referable to four genera: <i>Pempheris</i>,
  <i>Parapriacanthus</i>, <i>Neopempheris</i>, from the Indian, Pacific, and tropical Atlantic
  Oceans, and the deep-sea <i>Bathyclupea</i>, from the Indian and Caribbean Seas, at depths of 145
  to 419 fathoms.</p>

  processes. Two nostrils on each side. Gill-membranes free from isthmus; 5 to 7 branchiostegal
  rays; gills 4, a slit behind the fourth; pseudobranchiae more or less developed, often rudimentary
  or absent. Lower pharyngeal bones separate. Soft portion of dorsal fin not more developed than the

  Thirty-two species are known.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Cyphosidae.</b>&mdash;Herbivorous fishes, agreeing in their essential osteological
  characters with the preceding, differing in the incisor-like outer teeth and densely-scaled fins.
  Some 14 species are known, from the Pacific and Indian Oceans, referable to 4 genera:

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page658"><span class="smaller">{658}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Lobotidae.</b>&mdash;As in Centrarchidae, but transverse processes of vertebrae very
  short, and palate toothless. Two genera: <i>Lobotes</i>, with two species from the warm parts of
  the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic coast of America, and
  <i>Datnioides</i>, with two species from the estuaries of the Ganges and the rivers of Burma,
  Siam, and the Malay Peninsula and Archipelago.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Toxotidae.</b>&mdash;No subocular shelf; entopterygoid present; palate toothed;
  mouth very protractile; maxillary very slender. Ribs sessile, behind parapophyses which commence
  from the third vertebra. Two nostrils on each side. Gill-membranes free from isthmus; 7
  branchiostegal rays; gills 4, a slit behind the fourth; pseudobranchiae present. Lower pharyngeal
  bones separate. Ventral fins with 1 spine and 5 soft rays.</p>

  <p>A single genus, <i>Toxotes</i>, with 5 species from the fresh waters and coasts of the East
  Indies, N. Australia, Polynesia, and New Zealand. <i>Toxotes jaculator</i> derives its name from
  its habit of capturing insects flying near the surface of the water by shooting drops of water at
  them, a habit which it continues in captivity.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 8. Nandidae.</b>&mdash;No subocular shelf; no entopterygoid; palate toothed; mouth very

  bones separate. Soft portion of dorsal fin not more developed than the anal. Ventral fins with 1
  spine and 5 soft rays.</p>

  <p>Small carnivorous freshwater fishes, of which 14 species are known, referable to 6 genera:
  <i>Nandus</i>, <i>Catopra</i>, and <i>Badis</i> from South-Eastern Asia, <i>Polycentropsis</i>
  from West Africa, <i>Polycentrus</i> and <i>Monocirrus</i> from South America.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Percidae.</b>&mdash;No subocular lamina of the suborbitals; entopterygoid present.
  Anterior vertebrae without transverse processes; all or most of the ribs inserted on the
  transverse processes when these are developed. Two nostrils on each side. Mouth not or but feebly
  protractile. Gill-membranes free from the isthmus; 6 to 8 branchiostegal rays; gills 4, a slit
  behind the fourth; pseudobranchiae more or less developed, often rudimentary, rarely absent. Lower
  pharyngeal bones separate. Soft portion of dorsal fin not very much more developed than <span

  spines only. Ventrals with 1 spine and 5 soft rays.</p>

  <p>Embrace about 90 species from the freshwaters of the Northern Hemisphere, referable to 12
  genera: <i>Perca</i>, <i>Lucioperca</i>, <i>Percina</i>, <i>Etheostoma</i>, <i>Boleosoma</i>,
  <i>Ulocentra</i>, <i>Diplesium</i>, <i>Ammocrypta</i>, <i>Crystallaria</i>, <i>Aspro</i>,
  <i>Percarina</i>, <i>Acerina</i>. The British representatives of this family are the Perch
  (<i>Perca fluviatilis</i>) and the Pope (<i>Acerina cernua</i>). The largest forms are the
  Pike-Perches or Sander (<i>Lucioperca</i>) of Eastern Europe, Western Asia, and North America,
  which reach a length of 4 feet and are highly valued for the table. The American Darters
  (<i>Etheostoma</i> and allies), on the other hand, are among the smallest fishes, but many are
  remarkable for their brilliant coloration.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 10. Acropomatidae.</b>&mdash;An ill-defined group of marine fishes, some deep-sea,
  placed here provisionally as annectant between the Percidae and the Serranidae (Pomatominae),
  differing from the latter in the absence of a subocular shelf. Spinous dorsal short.</p>

  <p>About 28 species, mostly from the Pacific Ocean, distributed in 9 genera: <i>Propoma</i>,
  <i>Xenichthys</i>, <i>Xenocys</i>, <i>Synagrops</i>, <i>Malacichthys</i>, <i>Acropoma</i>,
  <i>Melanostoma</i>, <i>Epigonus</i> (<i>Telescops</i>), <i>Dinolestes</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 11. Serranidae.</b>&mdash;Second suborbital with an internal lamina supporting the

  <p>The earliest fossil form is <i>Prolates</i>, from the Upper Cretaceous of France.
  <i>Morone</i>, <i>Serranus</i>, <i>Percichthys</i>, <i>Anthias</i>, and <i>Apogon</i> are
  represented in Eocene and later strata.</p>

  <p>The range of the family is almost cosmopolitan; few of the Marine Perches descend to any great
  depth. Some of the species of <i>Stereolepis</i> and <i>Epinephelus</i> grow to a length of 6 to
  10 feet. Several species of <i>Serranus</i> (<i>S. cabrilla</i>, <i>S. scriba</i>, <i>S.
  hepatus</i>), inhabiting the Mediterranean and neighbouring parts of the Atlantic, and some
  <i>Lutjanus</i> are normally hermaphrodite. Some <i>Chilodipterus</i> and <i>Apogon</i> are
  remarkable for their nursing habits, the male sheltering the eggs in his mouth.</p>

  <p>The curious genera <i>Anomalops</i> and <i>Photoblepharon</i>, of each of which a single
  species is known from the Malay Archipelago and the South Pacific, have been made the types of a
  family, <b>Anomalopidae</b>, the systematic position of which remains uncertain since the
  osteological characters have not been examined. <span class="pagenum" id="page661"><span
  class="smaller">{661}</span></span>They are remarkable for the movable flap below the eye, bearing
  a luminous organ, the nature of which has recently been investigated by Max Weber.<a id="NtA_714"

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Marine, mostly of small size, inhabiting the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. About 30
  species. One of the largest and best-known members of this family is the Tile-Fish
  (<i>Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps</i>), living upon the bottom of what is known as the Gulf Stream
  slope, off the coast of New England, where it was first observed in 1879. Here the water is
  normally comparatively warm, coming as it does from the superheated region of the Gulf of Mexico.
  During a series of unusually severe gales in 1882, this mass of water was pushed aside, as it
  were, and replaced by colder water. As a result, millions and millions of these fishes were
  killed, and their dead bodies literally covered the surface of the sea for hundreds of square
  miles. It was feared that the Tile-Fish was exterminated; this was not so, however, and the fish
  has reappeared in tolerable abundance within the last few years.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 13. Cepolidae.</b>&mdash;Agree in essential characters with the preceding, but body
  band-like with very numerous vertebrae <span class="pagenum" id="page662"><span
  class="smaller">{662}</span></span>(15 + 54), and very elongate dorsal and anal fins formed of
  soft rays, of which all except the first three dorsal and the first anal are articulated and
  branched.</p>

  <p>Although these fishes have hitherto been placed near the Blenniidae, the Gobiidae, or the
  Trachypteridae, they are nothing but extremely elongate Perches, and they stand in the same
  relation to the Serranidae as the Trichiuridae to the Carangidae and Scombridae. They hardly

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page663"><span class="smaller">{663}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. 16. Sciaenidae.</b>&mdash;Also closely related to the Serranidae. Dorsal fin with a
  short spinous and a long soft portion; anal much shorter than the latter. Palate usually
  toothless.</p>

  <p>A large family of about 150 species, mostly marine. Principal genera: <i>Arripis, Sciaena,
  Corvina, Otolithus, Ancylodon, Nebris, Larimus, Pogonias, Haplonotus, Umbrina, Eques</i>.</p>

  <p>Many of these fishes reach a large size, and the flesh of nearly all is esteemed. The Meagre
  (<i>Sciaena aquila</i>) is sometimes taken on our coast. The Drum (<i>Pogonias chromis</i>) so
  called from the sounds which it produces, in common with many other Sciaenids, is remarkable for
  having the lower pharyngeal bones united, as is also the case in the North American freshwater
  genus <i>Haplonotus</i>. The air-bladder is usually large and complicated, provided with more or
  less numerous appendages.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 17. Gerridae.</b>&mdash;Agree in the character of the vertebral column with the
  Serranidae, but differ in the absence of a subocular shelf; the very protractile mouth usually
  descends when protruded and the praemaxillary emits an upward lateral process; palate toothless;
  lower pharyngeal bones usually large and more or less completely coalesced.</p>

  <p>About 60 species of carnivorous, mostly small, fishes, from the tropical seas, referable to 3
  genera: <i>Gerres, Equula, Gazza</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 18. Lactariidae.</b>&mdash;Intermediate between Serranidae and Trichodontidae. No
  subocular shelf; palate toothed; branchiostegal rays 7; scales small, cycloid, deciduous; spinous
  dorsal short; anal longer than the soft dorsal; scapula with two foramina.</p>

  <p><i>Lactarius delicatulus</i>, from the coasts of Southern Asia.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 19. Trichodontidae.</b>&mdash;Agree in the character of the vertebral column with the
  Serranidae, but have no subocular shelf; body naked, and anal much longer than the soft dorsal;
  palate toothless; only 5 branchiostegal rays.</p>

  <p>Two genera, each with a single species, from the North Pacific, <i>Trichodon</i> and
  <i>Arctoscopus</i>, bearing some resemblance to the Trachinidae, with which they have usually been
  associated.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 20. Latrididae.</b>&mdash;Marine Fishes intermediate between the Serranidae and the
  Haplodactylidae, agreeing with the former in the extent of the anal fin, which is nearly as long
  as the soft dorsal, and with the latter in the absence of a subocular shelf and the posterior
  position of the ventrals. A single genus, <i>Latris</i>, with 3 or 4 species, from the coasts of
  Australia and New Zealand.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page664"><span class="smaller">{664}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. 21. Haplodactylidae.</b>&mdash;No subocular shelf; entopterygoid present; palate
  usually toothless. Vertebrae with transverse processes from the third or fourth; all the ribs
  attached to the transverse processes when these are present; anterior epipleurals strong. Two
  nostrils on each side. Gill-membranes free from the isthmus; 5 or 6 branchiostegal rays; gills 4,
  a slit behind the fourth; pseudobranchiae present. Lower pharyngeal bones separate. Soft portion
  of the dorsal fin much more developed than the anal. Ventral fins with 1 spine and 5 soft rays,
  inserted far back behind the pectorals, the lower rays of which are simple and more or less
  thickened.</p>

  <p>This family embraces the genera <i>Haplodactylus, Chilodactylus, Chironemus</i>, and
  <i>Threpterius</i>, with some 30 species from the seas of the Southern Hemisphere and Japan. They
  feed chiefly on crustaceans, molluscs, and other invertebrates living among sea-weed.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 22. Pristipomatidae.</b>&mdash;No subocular shelf; entopterygoid present; palate
  toothless. Vertebrae with transverse processes from the third; all the ribs attached to the
  transverse processes. Two nostrils on each side. Gill-membranes free from isthmus; 5 to 7
  branchiostegal rays; gills 4, a slit behind the fourth; pseudobranchiae present. Lower pharyngeal
  bones separate. Ventral fins with 1 spine and 5 soft rays.</p>

  <p><i>Pristipoma, Haemulon, Diagramma</i>, and <i>Pentapus</i>, distributed over all the tropical
  and subtropical seas, a few entering fresh waters. About 130 species are known.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 23. Sparidae.</b>&mdash;Second suborbital with an internal lamina supporting the globe
  of the eye; entopterygoid present; palate usually toothless; teeth often either cutting in front,
  or molar-like on the sides. Vertebrae with transverse processes from the second or third; all the
  ribs attached to the transverse processes. Two nostrils on each side. Gill-membranes free from
  isthmus; 5 to 7 branchiostegal rays; gills 4, a slit behind the fourth; pseudobranchiae present.
  Lower pharyngeal bones separate. Soft portion of dorsal fin not much more developed than the anal.
  Ventral fins with 1 spine and 5 soft rays.</p>

  <p>The Sea-Breams embrace some 200 species, distributed over the coasts of nearly the whole world.
  Some are herbivorous, but the majority are carnivorous.</p>

  <p>Principal genera: <i>Scolopsis, Dentex, Synagris, Caesio, Maena, Oblata, Melambaphes, Girella,
  Doydixodon, Cantharus, Box</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page665"><span
  class="smaller">{665}</span></span><i>Crenidens, Pachymetopon, Dipterodon, Sargus, Charax,
  Lethrinus, Sphaerodon, Sparus, Pagrus, Pagellus</i>.</p>

  <p>Abundantly represented in Eocene and Miocene beds by remains of <i>Sargus, Sparus, Pagrus,
  Pagellus</i>, and by the extinct genera <i>Ctenodentex, Sparnodus</i>, and <i>Trigonodon</i>. Some
  species grow to a length of three feet, such as the "Sheep's-Head" of North America, one of the
  best salt-water fishes of the United States, and the "Schnapper" (<i>Sparus unicolor</i>), of
  Australia, also much esteemed. Some of the Atlantic and Mediterranean species of <i>Box, Sargus,
  Charax, Sparus</i>, and <i>Pagellus</i> are known to be normally, or at least very frequently,
  hermaphrodite.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 24. Mullidae.</b>&mdash;The "Red Mullets" are very nearly related to the Sparidae, with
  which they agree in the structure of the vertebral column and the presence of a subocular shelf.
  They differ in the very weak dentition, the presence of a pair of hyoid barbels, the reduced
  number (4) of branchiostegal rays, and the double perforation of the scapula. Two short dorsal
  fins, remote from each other, the anterior with weak spines.</p>

  <p>Small marine and brackish-water fishes, feeding on animalcules and decomposing matter;
  inhabitants of nearly all the tropical seas and extending to Northern Europe. About 50 species are
  known, referred to 5 genera: <i>Upeneoides, Upeneichthys, Mullus, Mulloides</i>, and
  <i>Upeneus</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page666"><span class="smaller">{666}</span></span></div>

  <p>The British species are <i>Mullus barbatus</i> and <i>M. surmuletus</i>, remarkable for their

  <p><b>Fam. 25. Scorpididae.</b>&mdash;Second suborbital with an internal lamina supporting the
  globe of the eye; entopterygoid present; palate toothed. Ribs sessile, behind the parapophyses
  when these are present. Two nostrils on each side. Gill-membranes free from isthmus; 7
  branchiostegal rays; gills 4, a slit behind the fourth; pseudobranchiae present. Lower pharyngeal
  bones separate. Ventral fins, if present, with 1 spine and 5 soft rays.</p>

  <p>This family embraces 12 species from the coasts of Africa, Southern Asia, Australia, and New
  Zealand, referable to 5 genera: <i>Scorpis</i>, <i>Atypichthys</i>, <i>Atyposoma</i>,
  <i>Henoplosus</i>, <i>Psettus</i>. The fish here figured (<i>Psettus sebae</i>, Fig. 408) is
  remarkable for the excessive depth of the body, which is greater than in any other species.</p>

  <p><i>Aipichthys</i>, one of the few Acanthopterygian types known to have existed in the
  Cretaceous period, appears to belong to the family Scorpididae as here defined, and not to the
  Carangidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 26. Caproidae.</b>&mdash;Characters of Scorpididae, but supratemporal completely
  ankylosed to the skull.</p>

  <p>The Boar-Fish (<i>Capros aper</i>) of the Atlantic and Mediterranean is occasionally found on
  our southern coasts, and is highly remarkable for the hair-like bristles with which its scales are
  <span class="pagenum" id="page667"><span class="smaller">{667}</span></span>covered, an extreme
  exaggeration of the "Ctenoid" type. The mouth is very protractile, and the vertebrae are only 22
  or 23 in number. <i>Antigonia</i>, with a single species found at remote points in the Atlantic,
  Pacific, and Indian Oceans, is probably allied to <i>Capros</i>, with which it is believed to be
  connected through the fossil genus <i>Proantigonia</i>, from the Upper Miocene of Croatia.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 27. Chaetodontidae.</b>&mdash;Closely allied to and evidently derived from the more
  generalised types of the Scorpididae, differing in the attachment of the gill-membranes to the
  isthmus. Post-temporal more or less firmly united with the skull, sometimes indistinctly
  bifurcate. Mouth small; palate toothless; soft portions of vertical fins usually covered with
  scales; ribs usually strong and blade-like; body short and deep.</p>

  <p>A large group of about 200 marine carnivorous fishes from the tropics, mostly of small size,
  remarkable for their singular forms and markings and brilliant coloration. They are particularly
  abundant about volcanic rocks and coral reefs.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page668"><span class="smaller">{668}</span></span></div>

  <p>An Atlantic species of <i>Ephippus</i> (<i>E. faber</i>) is extremely remarkable, when adult,
  for an enormously enlarged globular bony mass on the back of the head, formed by hypertrophy of
  the frontal and supraoccipital bones.</p>

  <p>Principal genera: <i>Ephippus, Parapsettus, Scatophagus, Chaetodon, Chelmo, Heniochus,
  Holacanthus, Pomacanthus, Platax</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Chaetodon, Holacanthus, Pomacanthus, Scatophagus, Ephippus</i>, and <i>Platax</i> were
  represented in the Eocene of Europe.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 28. Drepanidae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Drepane</i>, with a single species from the
  Indian Ocean, is very closely related to the Chaetodontidae, but it lacks the subocular shelf, and
  it is distinguished externally by the very elongate, falciform pectoral fin.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 29. Acanthuridae.</b>&mdash;A more or less developed subocular shelf; entopterygoid
  present. Mouth very small, not or but slightly protractile, the maxillary more or less firmly
  attached or ankylosed to the praemaxillary; teeth conical, bristle-like, or incisor-like. Palate
  toothless. Vertebrae 22 or 23, the praecaudals with strong transverse processes commencing from
  the first; ribs and epipleurals inserted on the transverse processes. Post-temporal not distinctly
  forked, ankylosed to the skull. Two nostrils on each side. Gill-membranes broadly attached to the
  isthmus; 4 or 5 branchiostegal rays; gills 4, a slit behind the fourth; pseudobranchiae present.
  Lower pharyngeal bones separate. Body covered with minute, often rough scales. Dorsal and anal
  fins elongate, with more or less strong spines. Ventrals with 1 spine and 2 to 5 soft rays.</p>

  <p>A family of about 80 species, mostly herbivorous, from the tropical seas, referred to 6 genera:
  <i>Zanclus, Ctenochaetus, Acanthurus, Colocopus, Prionurus, Naseus</i>. They form a connecting
  link between the Chaetodontidae and the Plectognathi.</p>

  <p>Remains from the Eocene of Europe have been referred to <i>Zanclus, Acanthurus</i>, and
  <i>Naseus</i>, and to the extinct genera <i>Aulorhamphus</i> and <i>Apostasis</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 30. Teuthididae.</b>&mdash;No subocular shelf; entopterygoid present. Mouth very small,
  beak-like, not protractile, with incisor-like teeth; maxillary ankylosed to the praemaxillary.
  Palate toothless. Two nostrils on each side. Gill-membranes broadly attached to the isthmus; 5
  branchiostegal rays; gills 4, a slit behind the fourth; pseudobranchiae present. Lower pharyngeal

  inserted on the ribs. Body covered with very small scales. Vertical fins elongate, with strong
  spines, 6 or 7 in the anal. Ventrals with 2 spines and 3 soft rays between them.</p>

  <p>A single recent genus, <i>Teuthis</i>, with about 30 species, herbivorous fishes from the
  Indian and Western Pacific Oceans. According to Bottard<a id="NtA_715"
  href="#Nt_715"><sup>[715]</sup></a> the sting from the spines of these fishes is much dreaded.
  <i>Archaeoteuthis</i>, from the Oligocene of Switzerland.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 31. Osphromenidae.</b>&mdash;Second suborbital with a more or less developed internal
  lamina; entopterygoid present; palate toothed. Most of the praecaudal vertebrae with transverse
  processes, to which the ribs are attached. Two nostrils on each side. Gill-membranes attached to
  isthmus; 4 to 6 branchiostegal rays; gills 4, a slit behind the fourth; pseudobranchiae absent.
  Lower pharyngeal bones separate. Vertical fins very variable in extent, the spines sometimes very
  numerous, sometimes absent. Ventral fins with not more than 5 soft rays, sometimes reduced to a
  filamentous ray. A superbranchial respiratory organ, situated in a cavity above the gills.</p>

  <p>Freshwater fishes having much in common with the Anabantidae, and likewise confined to
  South-Eastern Asia and Africa. Only 22 species are known, referable to 7 genera: <i>Helostoma</i>,
  <i>Polyacanthus</i>, <i>Osphromenus</i>, <i>Trichogaster</i>, <i>Luciocephalus</i>, <i>Betta</i>,
  and <i>Micracanthus</i>. The latter, the only African representative of the family (one species
  from the Ogowe), hardly differs from the Malay genus <i>Betta</i>. Most of the Osphromenidae are
  notable as aquarium fishes. The largest species, the Gourami (<i>Osphromenus olfax</i>), growing
  to a length of 2 feet, from the Malay Archipelago, is one of the best flavoured fishes of the Far
  East and has been acclimatised in India, the Guianas, and Mauritius. A domesticated variety of the
  Chinese <i>Polyacanthus opercularis</i>, known as <i>Macropodus viridi-auratus</i>, remarkable for
  the beauty of its form and colour, readily breeds in our aquariums. Like the Gourami, the male
  constructs a nest of air-bubbles, strengthened by a buccal secretion, and watches over the eggs
  and young. The little <i>Betta pugnax</i>, from South-Eastern Asia, derives its name from its
  excitable nature, which causes specimens to be kept by the Siamese in glass vessels where they
  engage in fights, special breeds being cultivated for the purpose. According to Cantor, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page670"><span class="smaller">{670}</span></span>the Siamese in 1840 were as
  infatuated with the combats of these fishes as the Malays are with their cock-fights, and the
  licence to exhibit them was farmed, bringing in a considerable annual revenue to the king.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 32. Embiotocidae.</b>&mdash;Second suborbital with an internal lamina supporting the
  globe of the eye; entopterygoid present; palate toothless. Ribs sessile, above and behind the
  parapophyses, where these are present. Two nostrils on each side. Gill-membranes free from
  isthmus; 5 or 6 branchiostegal rays; gills 4, a slit behind the fourth; pseudobranchiae present.
  Lower pharyngeals united, with conical or pavement-like teeth. Anal fin, with three spines.

  <p>Small or moderate-sized fishes inhabiting California and Japan, mostly marine, one species,
  however, inhabiting fresh waters, whilst another descends to a great depth. They feed mostly on
  crustaceans, but one genus (<i>Abcona</i>) is herbivorous. The name "Surf-Fishes," by which they
  are generally known, refers to the fact that most species are found in the surf along sandy
  beaches. All are viviparous in the strictest sense of the term, the young remaining for a long
  time closely packed in a sac-like enlargement of the oviduct analogous to a uterus; they are of
  relatively large size at birth, and quite similar in form to the parent, whilst at an earlier
  period they differ in having the vertical fins much more elevated. Twenty-four species are
  known.<a id="NtA_716" href="#Nt_716"><sup>[716]</sup></a> Principal genera: <i>Hysterocarpus</i>,

  <p>Fresh or brackish-water fishes, variable in form and dentition, some carnivorous, others
  chiefly herbivorous. In some American forms (<i>Cichla</i>) the males and females differ during
  the spawning season, the male developing a hump on the top of the head, which disappears
  afterwards. The eggs and young are cared for by the parents; either the male or the female,
  according to the species, sheltering them in the mouth or pharynx.<a id="NtA_717"

  <i>Platylaemus</i>, and <i>Pseudosphaerodon</i>, from the Eocene and Miocene, are referred, with
  doubt, to this family.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 36. Scaridae.</b>&mdash;Closely allied to the preceding, with which they have usually
  been united, but differing in the more or less coalescent teeth, forming often a parrot-like beak,
  the lower pharyngeals united into a concave or spoon-shaped bone with flat, tessellated teeth; and
  in the development of transverse processes from the first vertebra. Vertebrae 24 or 25.</p>

  <p>Curious, mostly brilliantly-coloured fishes of the tropical seas and the Mediterranean,
  especially abundant about coral-reefs. "Parrot-Wrasses" feed mostly on vegetable matter, corals,
  and on hard-shelled Mollusca, for crushing which their dentition is well adapted. The largest
  reach a length of 4 feet. Some are much valued as food, whilst others are reputed poisonous. About
  110 species are known, referable to 8 genera: <i>Cryptotomus</i> (<i>Calliodon</i>),
  <i>Calotomus</i>, <i>Sparisoma</i>, <i>Scarus</i>, <i>Pseudoscarus</i>, <i>Odax</i>,

  <p>No bony stay for the praeopercle. Spinous dorsal, if distinct, formed of short or feeble,
  slender spines. Epipleurals usually attached to the centra when ribs are sessile, or to the
  parapophyses of the vertebrae, rarely to the ribs. Pectoral arch similar to that of the
  Perciformes, but pterygials sometimes more abbreviated. Ventral fins thoracic. Caudal fin, if well
  developed, with very numerous rays deeply forked at the base.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Although bound by natural ties, the series of families that cluster round the
  Mackerel offer so many modifications of structure that it is almost impossible to draw up a
  diagnosis differentiating every one of its members from the Perciformes, with which they are
  closely connected, and from which they hardly deserve to be separated. Even after removing many
  genera which have been united with them by my predecessors, and which will now be found scattered
  among various groups of the system, no good definition of the Scombriformes can be given. The
  Mackerel and Horse-Mackerel are taken as the pattern-forms around which more or less aberrant
  types are located, types yet not so aberrant as to be traced back to these familiar forms through
  a number of intermediate grades. As <span class="pagenum" id="page676"><span
  class="smaller">{676}</span></span>regards external features, it may be stated that the dorsal and
  anal spines, if present, are either weak and slender, or, if strong, short and detached; the
  caudal peduncle is constricted, and the caudal fin, if well developed, is usually deeply forked,
  and with the forked bases of the very numerous rays much longer than in most of the Perciformes,
  embracing at least a considerable portion of the expanded hypural bones, a character by which the
  Chaetodontidae, Acanthuridae, and several extinct types which have been placed with the Carangidae
  are at once excluded. All are carnivorous and marine, and many are pelagic and of very wide
  distribution. No praetertiary members of this division, as here defined, have yet been found.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Carangidae.</b>&mdash;Praemaxillaries more or less protractile. Vertebrae 24 to 26;
  ribs behind the parapophyses; epipleurals on the parapophyses, rarely on the ribs.<a id="NtA_721"
  href="#Nt_721"><sup>[721]</sup></a> Body covered with small scales, or naked, often with enlarged
  scutes on each side of the body or of the tail; dorsal spines few, or slender or rudimentary; a
  more or less developed spine adnate to the soft portion of the anal, often preceded by a pair of
  spines separated from the rest of the fin. Pseudobranchiae usually present. Inhabitants of the
  seas of the temperate and tropical regions, many of the species having a very wide range. About
  150 species are known.</p>

  <p>Principal recent genera: <i>Caranx</i>, <i>Chloroscombrus</i>, <i>Selene</i>, <i>Mene</i>,
  <i>Apolectus</i>, <i>Nematistius</i>, <i>Seriola</i>, <i>Seriolichthys</i>, <i>Naucrates</i>,
  <i>Trachynotus</i>, <i>Zalocys</i>, <i>Lichia</i>, <i>Paropsis</i>, <i>Chorinemus</i>. Species of
  <i>Caranx</i>, <i>Mene</i>, and <i>Seriola</i> have been described from the Eocene and Miocene of
  Europe, in which occur also the fossil genera named <i>Vomeropsis</i>, <i>Archaeus</i>,
  <i>Carangopsis</i>, <i>Carangodes</i>, <i>Ductor</i>, and <i>Semiophorus</i>.</p>

  <p>The family is represented on our coasts by the common Horse-Mackerel, <i>Caranx trachurus</i>.
  The young of this species keep together in small bands in the neighbourhood of medusae, under
  which they seek shelter when disturbed. The Pilot-Fish, <i>Naucrates ductor</i>, is a truly
  pelagic fish of wide distribution, which occasionally appears on our coasts, accompanying large
  sharks and ships. Much has been written on the marvellous habits of this little fish, which is
  said to lead the shark like a pilot, directing it to its food, in exchange for which services the
  pilot enjoys protection from the fear which the proximity of its formidable companion inspires to
  its enemies among other carnivorous fishes, and an abundance of food from the shark's
  excrements.<a id="NtA_722" href="#Nt_722"><sup>[722]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Rhachicentridae.</b>&mdash;Praemaxillaries slightly protractile. Vertebrae 25 (11 +
  14), without well-developed parapophyses; ribs and epipleurals inserted close together on the
  centra. Body covered with very small scales; a series of short isolated dorsal spines; soft dorsal
  and anal long; pectorals <span class="pagenum" id="page678"><span
  class="smaller">{678}</span></span>inserted low down. A single genus, <i>Rhachicentrum</i>
  (<i>Elacate</i>), with a single species from the coasts of the tropical and warmer parts of the
  Atlantic and of the Indian Ocean.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Scombridae.</b>&mdash;Praemaxillaries large, not protractile, beak-like. Vertebrae
  30 to 50, without transverse processes, but some of the hinder praecaudals with haemal arches;
  ribs inserted on the centra or on the haemal arches when these are present; epipleurals all on the
  centra. Scales cycloid and usually very small (except in <i>Gastrochisma</i>), sometimes absent. A
  spinous dorsal fin formed of slender spines, folding into a sheath; soft dorsal longer and broken
  up into finlets, similar to the anal; pectoral inserted high up the sides. Hypural bones
  completely embraced by the forked bases of the caudal rays. Pseudobranchiae present.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    <div class="smaller ac">
      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 415.</span>&mdash;Tunny (<i>Thunnus thynnus</i>). (After
      Cuvier and Valenciennes.) &times; &#x215B;.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>About 50 species, referred to the following genera:&mdash;<i>Scomber</i>, <i>Auxis</i>,
  <i>Thunnus</i>, <i>Sarda</i>, <i>Cybium</i>, <i>Acanthocybium</i>, <i>Gastrochisma</i>
  (<i>Lepidothynnus</i>). Numerous fossil representatives in Tertiary beds, belonging to
  <i>Scomber</i>, <i>Auxis</i>, <i>Thunnus</i>, <i>Cybium</i>, and to the extinct genera
  <i>Eothynnus</i>, <i>Isurichthys</i>, <i>Palimphyes</i>, <i>Scombrinus</i>, <i>Sphyraenodus</i>,
  <i>Scombramphodon</i>.</p>

  <p>These fishes, elegant in form and often in colour, are among the swiftest of the inhabitants of
  the sea. Some are migratory, like the Mackerel (<i>Scomber scombrus</i>) of the North Atlantic,
  whilst others are remarkable for their wide distribution. The Tunny (<i>Thunnus thynnus</i>), for
  instance, the largest member of the family, reaching a length of 10 feet, inhabits the Atlantic,
  Pacific, and Indian Oceans, extending as far north as the British <span class="pagenum"
  id="page679"><span class="smaller">{679}</span></span>seas, Newfoundland, California, and Japan.
  It supplies important fisheries in France and Italy. The Tunnies are the only fish known to be
  warm-blooded.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Trichiuridae.</b>&mdash;Praemaxillaries not protractile. Vertebrae 32 to 160,
  without transverse processes; ribs sessile, on the centra or on the haemal arches when these are
  present; epipleurals, if well developed, on the centra. Scales very small or absent. Spinous
  portion of dorsal fin much longer than the soft, the spines more or less feeble. Pectoral fins
  inserted low down the sides. Pseudobranchiae present.</p>

  <p>The members of this family show a great variation in the shape of the body, which, although
  always strongly compressed, is not unlike that of a Mackerel in the more normal types, such as
  <i>Thyrsites</i> and <i>Ruvettus</i>, whilst, through a chain of genera, it generally assumes an
  extremely elongate form; concurrently with this elongation of the body, the dorsal fin loses its
  differentiation into two portions, the ventrals become reduced and disappear, as in the Scabbard-
  or Frost-Fish (<i>Lepidopus caudatus</i>), while the caudal fin decreases in size, loses its
  fork-shape, and is finally lost in <i>Trichiurus</i>, in which the body is ribbon-shaped and
  tapers to a point.</p>

  <p>About 25 species are known, pelagic and widely distributed, many descending to great
  depths.</p>

  <p>Principal living genera: <i>Ruvettus</i>, <i>Thyrsites</i>, <i>Epinnula</i>, <i>Nesiarchus</i>,
  <i>Nealotus</i>, <i>Promethichthys</i>, <i>Dicrotus</i>, <i>Gempylus</i>, <i>Aphanopus</i>,
  <i>Lepidopus</i>, <i>Euoxymetopon</i>, <i>Benthodesmus</i>, <i>Eupleurogrammus</i>,
  <i>Trichiurus</i>.</p>

  <p>Remains of several species referred to <i>Thyrsites</i>, <i>Lepidopus</i>, and to the extinct
  genera <i>Thyrsitocephalus</i>, <i>Hemithyrsites</i>, and <i>Trichiurichthys</i>, have been found
  in the Oligocene and Miocene of Europe.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Histiophoridae.</b>&mdash;Praemaxillaries not protractile; snout produced into a
  spear-shaped rostrum; a praedentary bone; teeth minute. Body elongate, covered with small or
  rudimentary scales. Vertebrae 24 or 25, without transverse processes; ribs sessile; no
  epipleurals. One or two dorsal fins, without a distinctly spinous portion. Pectoral fin low down
  the side. Pseudobranchiae present.</p>

  <p>The Sail-Fishes are large oceanic fishes, endowed with great strength and swiftness, occurring
  in the tropical and sub-tropical <span class="pagenum" id="page680"><span
  class="smaller">{680}</span></span>seas. Four or five species are distinguishable, and are
  referable to two genera: <i>Histiophorus</i>, with a single dorsal fin and 2 or 3 ventral rays,
  and <i>Tetrapturus</i>, with the dorsal divided into two parts and a single ventral ray.<a
  id="NtA_723" href="#Nt_723"><sup>[723]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Fossil Histiophoridae are known from the Eocene and later beds in Europe and America. Dr. A. S.
  Woodward observes that the known fossils are too imperfect to be referred with certainty to their
  respective genera. Most of them probably belong to <i>Histiophorus</i>, but at least one genus
  from the Eocene (<i>Xiphiorhynchus</i>) appears to be well distinguished.</p>

      Mediterranean. (After Cuvier and Valenciennes.) &times; &#x2152;.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The imperfectly known extinct family <b>Palaeorhynchidae</b>, from the seas of the Eocene,
  Oligocene, and Miocene periods, with the genera <i>Palaeorhynchus</i> and <i>Hemirhynchus</i>, is
  probably closely related to the Histiophoridae. The vertebrae number 50 to 60, and the ribs
  completely encircle the body. In <i>Palaeorhynchus</i> both jaws are equally produced into an
  ensiform weapon. <i>Blochius</i>, from the Eocene, with diamond-shaped, slightly overlapping bony
  scutes on the body, is perhaps also to be placed near this family.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page681"><span class="smaller">{681}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Xiphiidae.</b>&mdash;Differs from the preceding in the absence of praedentary bone,
  and in the vertebrae (26 in number), which in the praecaudal region are provided with short but
  well-developed transverse processes, to which the short ribs are attached. Ventral fins absent,
  the pectorals being inserted in the place usually occupied by them. Adult without teeth or
  scales.</p>

  <p>A single species, the Sword-Fish (<i>Xiphias gladius</i>), of nearly world-wide distribution,
  occurring occasionally on the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Luvaridae.</b>&mdash;Mouth small, praemaxillaries not protractile, with very feeble
  dentition. Gill-membranes attached to the isthmus. Vertebrae 23, without transverse processes;
  ribs blade-like, inserted on the centra; no epipleurals. Body rough, with minute scales. Dorsal
  and anal fins elongate, formed of unarticulated, widely set rays. Pectoral fins inserted rather
  low down; ventrals much reduced, the two halves of the pelvis fused into a single bone.
  Supraclavicle fused with the forked post-temporal. Hypural bones completely embraced by the forked
  bases of the caudal rays. Pseudobranchiae present.</p>

  <p><i>Luvarus imperialis</i>, a rare pelagic fish from the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pacific,
  growing to a length of 6 feet, and occasionally captured on our coasts, is the only representative
  of this family. Very little is known of the habits of this strange fish. The excessive length of
  the intestines and the feeble dentition point to its feeding partly on vegetable matter, partly on
  minute animals; the circumstances under which certain specimens were captured tend to indicate
  that they follow up streams of pelagic life such as engage the attention of the Basking Shark, of
  similar distribution.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 8. Coryphaenidae.</b>&mdash;Praemaxillaries small, not protractile. Vertebrae 30 to 33,
  without transverse processes; ribs and epipleurals attached close together on the centra. Body
  elongate; scales small, cycloid or elongate lanceolate. Dorsal and anal fins much elongate,
  without distinct spines. Pectoral fins inserted rather low down the side. Pseudobranchiae
  absent.</p>

  <p>The "Dolphins" (<i>Coryphaena</i>), of which only two species can be distinguished, are large
  pelagic fishes, of carnivorous habits, pursuing the Flying-Fish. They grow to a length of 6 feet,
  and their flesh is much valued. Their deep head, with short snout, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page682"><span class="smaller">{682}</span></span>and their long posteriorly attenuate body
  ending in a large forked caudal fin, give them a peculiar appearance.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Bramidae.</b>&mdash;Praemaxillaries small, not or but feebly protractile;
  maxillaries large, scaly. Vertebrae 42 to 47, the praecaudal without transverse processes, but
  mostly with h&aelig;mal arches to which the ribs are attached, the epipleurals being inserted on the
  centra. Body deep; scales moderate or large, strongly imbricate, with processes which, in certain
  parts at least, serve to connect the rows of scales. Dorsal and anal elongate, some or all of the
  rays simple, but not forming true spines. Pectoral inserted rather low down the side, freely
  movable upwards and downwards. Pseudobranchiae present.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Pelagic fishes, often descending to great depths. About 12 species are known,<a
  id="NtA_724" href="#Nt_724"><sup>[724]</sup></a> referable to 6 genera: <i>Brama</i>,
  <i>Taractes</i>, <i>Pterycombus</i>, <i>Pteraclis</i>, <i>Bentenia</i>, and <i>Steinegeria</i>.
  <i>Taractes</i>, often confounded with <i>Brama</i>, differs from it not only in the larger,
  keeled scales, but also in the protractile mouth and in the much greater development of most of
  the ribs, which form curved lamellae of great width.<a id="NtA_725"
  href="#Nt_725"><sup>[725]</sup></a> <i>Pteraclis</i> is very remarkable for the enormous,
  sail-like dorsal and anal fins.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Division</span> III.&mdash;ZEORHOMBI.</p>

  <p>Aberrant, strongly compressed Perciformes, with very short praecaudal region, modified much as
  in the Flat-Fishes, culminating in asymmetrical forms, and characterised by the combination of an
  increased number (7 to 9) of ventral rays, with absence of hypural spine (by which the Berycidae
  are excluded), <i>or</i> by asymmetry of the skull in the forms in which the spine of the ventral
  fin has been lost.</p>

  <p>Among the symmetrical forms, the existing Zeidae agree with the Berycidae in having more than
  five soft rays to the ventral fins, and are probably derived, together with the Eocene
  Amphistiidae, from some common ancestral group still to be discovered in Cretaceous beds. These
  Zeidae have much in common with the Pleuronectidae,<a id="NtA_726"
  href="#Nt_726"><sup>[726]</sup></a> and might be regarded as <span class="pagenum"
  id="page683"><span class="smaller">{683}</span></span>forming part of the family out of which the
  latter have sprung, were it not that they have lost the last half-gill. <i>Amphistium</i> is
  probably more nearly related to the Pleuronectidae, which may have been directly derived from the
  family of which it is as yet the only known representative.<a id="NtA_727"
  href="#Nt_727"><sup>[727]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This division embraces three families only:&mdash;</p>

    <p class="sp0">&dagger; Extinct.</p>
  </div>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Zeidae.</b>&mdash;No subocular shelf; praemaxillaries strongly protractile.
  Gill-membranes free from isthmus; 7 or 8 branchiostegal rays; gills 3&frac12;; pseudobranchiae well
  developed. Lower pharyngeal bones separated. Vertebrae 30 to 46, the anterior with sessile ribs,
  the posterior praecaudals with long neural spines bent forwards and with transverse processes
  directed downwards, forming haemal arches and bearing the ribs at their extremity; epipleurals
  much reduced or absent; hypural large, without the basal spine or knob present in most Perciformes
  and all Scombriformes and Percesoces, bearing fewer than 20 rays. Dorsal and anal fins elongate,
  the former with a distinct spinous portion, the latter with 1 to 4 spines detached from the soft
  portion. Pectoral fin supported by 4 pterygials, of which 3 are in contact with the perforated
  scapular bone; post-temporal forked and solidly attached to the skull. Ventral fin with 1 spine
  and 6 to 8 soft rays.</p>

  <p>Scales small or minute, sometimes hard and rough and firmly joined in vertical series; bony
  plates may be present along the base of the vertical fins. Air-bladder present.</p>

  <p>Twelve species are known from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, referable to 5 genera:
  <i>Grammicolepis</i>, <i>Cyttus</i>, <i>Cyttopsis</i>, <i>Zenion</i>, and <i>Zeus</i>.
  <i>Oreosoma</i> was founded on a young form of a fish allied to <i>Cyttus</i>. Remains of
  <i>Zeus</i> occur in the Oligocene, and <i>Cyttoides</i>, from the same period, has been compared
  with <i>Cyttus</i>.</p>

  <p>The well-known John Dory (<i>Zeus faber</i>) is much valued for the table.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page684"><span class="smaller">{684}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Amphistiidae.</b>&mdash;The only known representative of this family, the Upper
  Eocene <i>Amphistium paradoxum</i>, originally described as a <i>Pleuronectes</i>, has much in
  common with the Zeidae, from which it differs in the smaller number of vertebrae (10 + 14), and in
  the dorsal and anal spines being more reduced, adnate and continuous with the series of soft rays;
  the scales are more normal and imbricate; ventral fins with 1 spine and 8 soft rays. This fish
  appears to realise in every respect the prototype of the Pleuronectidae before they had assumed
  the asymmetry which characterises them as a group.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Pleuronectidae.</b>&mdash;Head asymmetrical, the skull twisted in front, with the
  two orbits on one side in the adult; the side of the body bearing the eyes and turned upwards in
  life being coloured, the other side colourless and blind. Mouth more or less protractile. Gills 4,
  a slit behind the fourth; pseudobranchiae present. Lower pharyngeal bones usually separated,
  rarely imperfectly united. Vertebrae 24 in the most generalised form (<i>Psettodes</i>), varying
  from 28 to 65 in others, the praecaudals mostly with more or less developed transverse processes,
  which may be directed downwards and become converted into haemal arches; ribs and epipleurals
  present. Caudal fin, if well developed, supported by a large hypural usually without basal spine
  or knob. Dorsal and anal fins much elongate, without spines, the former often extending on the
  head. Paired fins often reduced, <span class="pagenum" id="page685"><span
  class="smaller">{685}</span></span>sometimes absent; if fully developed and normally formed, the
  bones of the pectoral and pelvic girdles as in the Zeidae. Ventral fins usually with 5 to 7 soft
  rays.</p>

  <p>Scales usually imbricate, cycloid or ctenoid; rarely absent; bony tubercles sometimes present.
  Air-bladder absent.</p>

  <p>Most species, and even genera, are either sinistral or dextral, but this is inconstant in some,
  including the most generalised genus, <i>Psettodes</i>. The very young are transparent and
  symmetrical, with an eye on each side, and swim in a vertical position like other Fishes. These
  larval forms have been described as distinct genera, under the names of <i>Peloria</i>,
  <i>Bibronia</i>, <i>Charybdia</i>, etc. As they grow, the eye of one side moves by degrees to the
  other side, where it becomes the upper eye. If at that age the dorsal fin does not extend to the
  frontal region, the migrating eye simply moves over the line of the profile, temporarily assuming
  the position which it preserves in <i>Psettodes</i>, <i>Atheresthes</i>, and
  <i>Platysomatichthys</i>; in other genera, the dorsal fin has already extended to the snout before
  the migration takes place, and the eye, passing between the frontal bone and the tissues
  supporting the fin, appears to pass from side to side through the head, as was believed by some of
  the earlier observers.<a id="NtA_728" href="#Nt_728"><sup>[728]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Flat-fishes are a large group of some 500 species, mostly marine, a few species related to the
  Soles being confined to the fresh waters of South America and the Malay Archipelago. They range
  from the Arctic Circle to the southern coasts of the Southern Hemisphere; many occur at great
  depths (<i>Citharichthys dinoceros</i> down to 955 fathoms). Well-preserved remains referred to
  <i>Psetta</i> occur in the Upper Eocene, and a species of <i>Solea</i> is known from the Lower
  Miocene.</p>

  <p>A satisfactory classification of the Pleuronectidae is still a desideratum, and cannot be
  attempted until the osteology of the very numerous forms has been thoroughly studied. Even the
  division into two principal groups, regarded by some recent authors as families, Pleuronectidae
  and Soleidae, is based on characters which the examination of a large number of generic types
  shows not to be constant. Thus the former have been defined as having the praeopercular margin
  distinct externally, the snout not projecting beyond the mouth, the nostrils of the two sides on
  the coloured side or those of the blind side high up near the dorsal line of the head; the latter
  as having the praeoperculum hidden under the skin, the snout projecting more or less beyond the
  mouth, and the nasal organ of the blind side similarly situated to that of the eyed side. However,
  the genera <i>Aphoristia</i> and <i>Peltorhamphus</i>, and others among the Soles, show exceptions
  to this definition.<a id="NtA_729" href="#Nt_729"><sup>[729]</sup></a></p>

  following are immovably fixed between rings formed by the ossification of the outer membrane of
  the elongate air-bladder in a manner unique among fishes. The skull is peculiar for its very
  strong, denticulate, occipital crest, which ends posteriorly in a curved spine bent forwards; the

  <p>A large family of some 600 species, the great majority marine, mostly carnivorous and of small
  size. The largest form (<i>Eleotris marmorata</i>, from the rivers of Siam, Borneo, and Sumatra)
  grows to nearly 3 feet, whilst the smallest (<i>Mistichthys luzonensis</i>, from the Philippines)
  measures only 12 to 14 millimetres, and is believed to be the smallest known Vertebrate. Gobiids
  occur in all the seas outside the Arctic and Antarctic circles, and they have representatives in
  the fresh waters of all parts of the world.</p>

  <p>The genera are numerous but difficult of definition. The following are the principal:
  <i>Eleotris</i>, <i>Oxymetopon</i>, <i>Vireosa</i>, <i>Rhyacichthys</i>, <i>Gobius</i>,

  which has been made the type of a distinct family, appears to differ from <i>Trypauchen</i> only
  in the absence of ventral fins. Fossils referred to <i>Gobius</i> have been described from the
  Upper Eocene and Miocene of Europe, but there is no satisfactory evidence that they really belong
  to this family.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Gobius</i>, of which several species are of common occurrence on our shores,
  have attracted special interest from their habits during the much prolonged breeding season. The
  male, usually more brilliantly coloured than the female, mounts guard over the eggs, which are
  either simply fixed by the female to the under surface of stones or weeds, or in a sort of nest
  built and kept in constant repair by him. This nest is usually made of a shell of <i>Cardium</i>,
  <i>Patella</i>, <i>Haliotis</i>, etc., or of the carapace of a crab, with the convexity turned
  upwards and covered with sand; the sand underneath is hollowed out, and a round opening at the
  side, coated by a mucus secreted by the skin of the male fish, gives access to the interior; the
  eggs, which are elongate and pyriform, are stuck to the inner surface of the shell forming the
  roof.<a id="NtA_730" href="#Nt_730"><sup>[730]</sup></a> A curious British form is <i>Aphia
  pellucida</i>, two inches long which, from its transparent and almost colourless body, has long
  been erroneously supposed to be the fry of some larger fish. Among exotic forms, mention should be
  made of the Blind Goby (<i>Typhlogobius californiensis</i>), two inches long, uniform light pink,
  scaleless, with the eyes very small, reduced to mere vestiges, covered by skin, and functional
  only in the young, living like a slug under rocks between tide marks on the coast of California;<a

  <p class="sp3">In spite of a superficial external resemblance to the genus <i>Elacate</i>, the
  Sucking-Fish bear certainly no affinity to that genus nor to other Scombriformes, as first
  observed by Gill. They are probably derived from Perciformes, but from which family it is
  impossible to suggest. Three genera may be distinguished: <i>Opisthomyzon</i>, from the Upper
  Eocene of Switzerland, with a very small suctorial disk and 23 or 24 vertebrae; <i>Echeneis</i>,
  with large disk and 30 vertebrae; and <i>Remora</i>, distinguished from the second by a shorter
  body with only 27 vertebrae. These remarkable fishes, of which about 10 species are distinguished,
  are distributed all over the tropical and warm seas, and exceptionally carried as far north as the
  south coast of England. They feed on other fishes, and attach themselves by means of their
  cephalic <span class="pagenum" id="page692"><span class="smaller">{692}</span></span>sucker to
  boats or to sharks, turtles, cetaceans, and other large swift-swimming animals. On the East Coast
  of Africa they are employed by the natives for catching turtles, to the carapace of which they
  stick with extraordinary tenacity, being held by a line attached to a metal ring round the caudal

  <p>The "Cheek-armoured Acanthopterygians," "Joues cuirass&eacute;es" of Cuvier, after the exclusion of
  the Sticklebacks, form a perfectly natural association, evidently derived from the Serranidae,
  with which the more generalised forms have much in common. From the Perch-like genus,
  <i>Sebastes</i>, a continuous series can be traced towards the Triglidae, especially through such
  forms as <i>Apistus</i>, <i>Minous</i>, and <i>Choridactylus</i>, in which one or more of the
  lower pectoral rays are detached from the rest of the fin. Through the Comephoridae the
  Scorpaenidae are connected with the Cottidae, whilst the latter merge insensibly into the still
  more aberrant Cyclopteridae. These conclusions, which are apparent enough from a mere comparison
  of the external characters, become fortified by a study of the skeletons. The passage between the
  various groups here accepted as families is so complete that no <span class="pagenum"
  id="page693"><span class="smaller">{693}</span></span>serious objection could be raised to their
  union in one great family with a number of minor divisions.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The character from which the Scleroparei derive their name is subject to many

  be merely enlarged and prolonged over the cheek towards the praeoperculum (<i>Sebastes</i>,
  <i>Anoplopoma</i>), or firmly ankylosed to the latter (<i>Scorpaena</i>, <i>Platycephalus</i>), or
  form part of the external armature of the head (<i>Trigla</i>, <i>Dactylopterus</i>). The
  structure of the base of the pectoral fin appears to afford important characters for the
  definition of the families, as first pointed out by Gill; these <span class="pagenum"

  <p>Four genera, each with a single species: <i>Anoplopoma</i> (<i>Scombrocottus</i>), from the
  North Pacific from Unalaska to California; <i>Triglopsis</i>, from deep water in Lakes Michigan
  and Ontario; <i>Cottocomephorus</i>, from Lake Baikal, and <i>Comephorus</i> from the greatest
  depths of that lake. As in many bathybial forms, <i>Comephorus</i> is colourless and provided with
  very large eyes; ventral fins are absent and the skeleton is very thin and papery. As a result of
  this condition, the second suborbital is not produced over the cheek, a unique exception to the
  main characteristic of this division; but no doubt can be entertained as to the propriety of
  referring it to the neighbourhood of <i>Anoplopoma</i>, since the recently discovered
  <i>Cottocomephorus</i> may be regarded as a connecting link between the two genera.
  <i>Comephorus</i> is viviparous, and dies after parturition.<a id="NtA_738"
  href="#Nt_738"><sup>[738]</sup></a> Jordan regards <i>Triglopsis</i> as a relic of a former Arctic
  marine fauna.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Rhamphocottidae.</b>&mdash;Head incompletely cuirassed, with spines; basis cranii
  simple; two nostrils on each side. Gill-opening narrow, above the base of the pectoral; gills 3&frac12;.
  Vertebrae 24. Post-temporal short and flat, ankylosed to the skull; scapula and coracoid well
  developed, separated by cartilage; pectoral rays inserted on the scapula and on 4 plate-like
  pterygials, 2 of which are in contact with the coracoid. Ventral fins close together, behind the
  pectorals, with a rudimentary spine and 3 soft rays. Spinous dorsal shorter than the soft; no anal
  spines. Body densely covered with small prickly scales.</p>

  <p><i>Rhamphocottus richardsonii</i>, a small fish 3 inches in length, from the north-west coast
  of North America, is the only representative of this family.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Cottidae.</b>&mdash;Head not or but incompletely cuirassed, usually with spines;
  basis cranii simple; parietal bones often meeting on the median line; two nostrils on each side.
  Gill-membranes free or attached to isthmus; gills 3&frac12; or 4; pseudobranchiae usually present.
  Vertebrae 24 to 50, the anterior praecaudals with sessile ribs, the posterior with transverse
  processes, often directed downwards, or forming haemal arches, bearing ribs and epipleurals.
  Post-temporal more or less distinctly forked; scapula and coracoid separated from each other <span
  class="pagenum" id="page698"><span class="smaller">{698}</span></span>by the intervention of the
  plate-like pterygials, of which one, two, or three are in contact with the clavicle; the coracoid
  more or less reduced. Ventral fins close together, with 1 spine and 2 to 5 soft rays (absent in
  <i>Ereunias</i>). Spinous dorsal usually shorter than the soft, sometimes quite indistinct; anal
  without spines. Body naked, partially scaly, or with prickles or bony plates.</p>

  <p>Mostly small carnivorous fishes, the largest (<i>Scorpaenichthys</i>) growing to about 3 feet.
  Some species inhabit fresh waters, but the majority are marine, a few descending to great depths.
  Nearly all are from the northern regions, but a genus allied to <i>Cottus</i>
  (<i>Sclerocottus</i>) is from South Georgia, in the Antarctic region. Fossil Cottidae are known
  from the Upper Eocene and Miocene (<i>Eocottus</i>, <i>Lepidocottus</i>), and are distinguished
  from the modern forms in the smaller number of vertebrae (24 or 26 instead of 30 to 50). At least
  220 species are known. Principal genera: <i>Jordania</i>, <i>Scorpaenichthys</i>, <i>Icelus</i>,
  <i>Triglops</i>, <i>Cottus</i>, <i>Cottunculus</i>, <i>Blepsias</i>, <i>Pseudoblennius</i>,
  <i>Hemitripterus</i>, <i>Synchirus</i>, <i>Ascelichthys</i>, <i>Psychrolutes</i>, <i>Ereunias</i>.
  The little freshwater "Miller's Thumb" (<i>Cottus gobio</i>) and the larger marine "Bull-heads"
  (<i>C. bubalis</i> and <i>C. scorpius</i>) are the most familiar British representatives of this
  family. The eggs are deposited on stones, weeds, or other submerged objects, or in a sort of nest,
  and are guarded by the male, which in most species is distinguished by a large genital papilla;
  this, in some forms, acts as an intromittent organ.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Cyclopteridae.</b>&mdash;Very closely related to the preceding, with which they are
  connected through <i>Psychrolutes</i>, and it is even doubtful whether they deserve to be
  separated from them. The only important distinctive characters reside in the structure of the
  ventrals, which, if present (absent in <i>Paraliparis</i>, a close ally of <i>Liparis</i>), are
  united to form a sucking disk, and the small size of the gill-cleft. The body is short, tumid,
  tadpole-like, naked or tubercular; the spinous dorsal, if present, is short. Vertebrae 28 to 60,
  the skeleton feebly ossified.<a id="NtA_739" href="#Nt_739"><sup>[739]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Sluggish fishes, feeding on small animals and plants, from the North Atlantic and Pacific
  Oceans, and the Arctic and Antarctic seas, many descending to great depths (1800 fathoms). About
  fifty species are distinguished. Principal genera: <i>Cyclopterus</i>, <i>Cyclopterichthys</i>,
  <i>Liparops</i>, <i>Liparis</i>, <i>Careproctus</i>, <i>Paraliparis</i>.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page699"><span class="smaller">{699}</span></span></div>

  <p>The common Lump-Sucker of our coasts (<i>Cyclopterus lumpus</i>) is the largest member of the
  group, growing to a length of 2 feet or more. The male makes pits in the sand between stones, in
  which the female deposits the eggs; he watches over the eggs and also over the young, which cling
  to his body with their suckers. The "Sea-Snails" (<i>Liparis</i>), are represented by two species
  on the British coasts.</p>

  Vertebrae 27; ribs all sessile, bearing the epipleurals. Post-temporal forked; scapula and
  coracoid well developed, in contact with each other; pectoral rays inserted on the scapula and on
  4 short and broad pterygials, 2 of which are in contact with the coracoid. Ventral fins widely
  separated, behind the pectorals, with 1 spine and 5 soft rays. Spinous dorsal shorter than the
  soft; anal without spines. Body covered with small scales.</p>

  <p>The single genus <i>Platycephalus</i>, with some 40 species, inhabits the coasts of the Indian
  Ocean and the Western Pacific.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 8. Hoplichthyidae.</b>&mdash;Head incompletely cuirassed, much depressed, with spines;
  basis cranii simple; two nostrils on each side. Gill-membranes attached to isthmus; gills 4;

  Post-temporal fused with the skull; scapula and coracoid in contact with each other; pectoral rays
  inserted on the scapula and on 3 plate-like pterygials. Ventral fins widely separated, a little

  spines. Back and sides with bony, prickly plates.</p>

  <p><i>Hoplichthys</i>, with a single species from the coasts of Japan and China. <i>Bembras</i>,
  with two species from the coasts of Japan, appears to be related to it, but the skeleton is still
  unknown; it differs in having the body covered with small scales and the gill-membranes free.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Agonidae.</b>&mdash;Head completely cuirassed, usually with spines; basis cranii
  simple; two nostrils on each side. Gill-membranes free or attached to isthmus; gills 3&frac12;;

  scapula and coracoid in contact with each other, or separated by a cartilaginous space; pectoral
  rays inserted on the scapula and 3 or 4 plate-like pterygials. Ventral fins close together, with 1
  spine and 2 soft rays. Spinous dorsal shorter than the soft, or absent; anal without spines. Body
  covered with bony plates.</p>

  <p>Small fishes, mostly from the coasts of the Northern Atlantic and Pacific, extending into the
  Arctic Ocean; one species from the coast of Chili. <i>Bathyagonus</i> occurs in the North Atlantic
  between 350 and 477 fathoms.</p>

  <p>About 40 species are known. Principal genera: <i>Agonus</i>, <i>Agonopsis</i>,
  <i>Bathyagonus</i>, <i>Aspidophoroides</i>. The "Pogge," or Armed Bullhead (<i>Agonus
  cataphractus</i>), is the only British species of this family.</p>

  posterior with transverse processes. Post-temporal fused with the skull; scapula and coracoid
  separated by a cartilaginous space; pectoral rays inserted on the scapula and on 4 large
  plate-like pterygials, of which two are in contact with the coracoid; 2 or 3 of the lower pectoral
  rays detached, forming feelers. Ventral fins widely separated, with 1 spine and 5 soft rays.
  Spinous dorsal shorter than the soft; anal without spines. Body covered with scales or bony
  plates.</p>

  <p>Marine fishes from all warm and temperate regions, some occurring in deep water. They are
  remarkable for the <span class="pagenum" id="page701"><span
  class="smaller">{701}</span></span>finger-like appendages of the pectoral fins, which are employed
  to feel the ground in search of crustaceans and other small animals on which they feed; also for
  the grunting sounds which they utter by the contraction of the air-bladder. About 50 species are
  known, referable to 4 genera: <i>Prionotus</i>, <i>Trigla</i>, <i>Lepidotrigla</i>,
  <i>Peristedion</i>. Fossil remains referred to <i>Trigla</i> have been found in Miocene and later

  <p class="sp3">The "Flying Gurnards," of which four species are known, belonging to a single genus

  id="page702"><span class="smaller">{702}</span></span>wing-like portion of the pectoral fins, by
  which they are able to move in the air like <i>Exocoetus</i>, but for shorter distances, and,

  grasshoppers;<a id="NtA_740" href="#Nt_740"><sup>[740]</sup></a> the young, however, have
  comparatively short pectorals, and were formerly regarded as belonging to a distinct genus

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">Division VIII.</span>&mdash;JUGULARES.</p>

  <p>No bony stay for the praeoperculum. Ventral fins jugular or mental. Gill-openings in front of
  the pectoral fin, the base of which is vertical or subvertical.</p>

  <p>In a recently published note<a id="NtA_741" href="#Nt_741"><sup>[741]</sup></a> I have alluded
  to the group of Physoclistous fishes for which I proposed to revive the old name Jugulares,
  pointing out that some of the forms previously grouped together as Trachinidae agree with the
  Gadidae, not only in the jugular position of the ventral fins, but also in the condition of the
  scapula and coracoid. Mr. Regan<a id="NtA_742" href="#Nt_742"><sup>[742]</sup></a> has since been
  able to show that the Gadidae and Macruridae possess certain characters in common by which they
  may be separated not only from the other Jugulares, but even from the Acanthopterygians, and, as
  mentioned above (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page646">646</a></span>), the M&uuml;llerian Sub-order
  Anacanthini may be maintained, after excluding the Pleuronectidae. That the Blenniidae are akin to
  <i>Lycodes</i> and its allies has long been admitted, and authors who have placed them in
  different divisions of their systems have had to confess the difficulty of referring certain
  genera to the one family rather than to the other. The fact that <i>Lycodes</i> and many forms
  previously associated with the Ophidiidae agree with the Macruridae and Gadidae in the diphycercal
  vertebral column and in the absence of spines to the fins is merely, it seems to me, the result of
  degradation; they probably form the terminal group of a series in which the vertebral column was
  originally homocercal and fin-spines were present, as is the case in most of the Blenniidae and
  Trachinidae and their near allies. All these families may be assumed to have evolved in several
  series, often on parallel lines, from some group closely related to the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page703"><span class="smaller">{703}</span></span>Berycidae; and the resemblance which their
  terminal forms bear to the Anacanthini is, as pointed out by Regan, probably to be ascribed to
  convergence, not to any close genetic affinity, as hitherto believed by many authors.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The character of the position of the scapular foramen, either in the scapular bone

  of the Anacanthini, has proved to be unreliable even for the purpose of family definition; it is,
  however, of assistance in determining the relation of certain obscure, degraded forms placed by
  some authors with the Anacanthines, by others with the Blenniids.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Trachinidae.</b>&mdash;Second suborbital with an internal lamina, supporting the
  globe of the eye; mouth large, protractile. Ribs and epipleurals nearly equally developed,
  sessile; posterior praecaudal vertebrae with short parapophyses. Gill-membranes free from isthmus;
  6 branchiostegal rays; gills 4, a slit behind the fourth; pseudobranchiae well developed. Scapula
  and coracoid well developed, a foramen between them; pectoral rays attached to the scapula and to
  three short and broad pterygials, two of which are in contact with the coracoid. Ventral fins
  jugular, close together, with 1 spine and 5 soft rays. Body elongate, covered with small cycloid
  scales forming oblique bands. A short spinous dorsal and a long soft dorsal and anal. Vertebrae
  35-43 (10-11 + 25-32). No air-bladder.</p>

  <p>This family includes but one genus (<i>Trachinus</i>), the Weevers, with 4 species, occurring
  on the coasts of Europe, the <span class="pagenum" id="page705"><span
  class="smaller">{705}</span></span>Mediterranean, and West Africa north of the Equator. A fossil
  species has been described from the Upper Miocene of Croatia. The two British species, <i>T.
  draco</i> and <i>T. vipera</i>, are well known for the painful wounds which they are able to
  inflict through their sharp, grooved dorsal and opercular spines, which convey a very active
  poisonous fluid secreted by small glands at their base. As these fish like to bury themselves
  partially in the sands in shallow water, people bathing occasionally tread on them with, as a
  rule, at least violent pain as a result.<a id="NtA_743" href="#Nt_743"><sup>[743]</sup></a> The
  flesh is not bad eating, and great numbers of the larger species (<i>T. draco</i>), are brought to
  the Paris market.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Percophiidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Percophis</i>, with a single species from the coast of
  Brazil, differs from the Trachinidae in the scapular fenestra being situated entirely in the
  scapula, in the ventral fins being rather widely separated at the base, and in the quincuncial
  disposition of the scales. Vertebrae, 57 (22 + 35). <i>Bleekeria</i> and <i>Embolichthys</i>, from
  the Indian and Japanese seas, with the ventral fins rudimentary or absent, which have been placed
  in the Ammodytidae, appear to be related to <i>Percophis</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Leptoscopidae.</b>&mdash;Differ from the preceding in the absence of a subocular
  shelf. Scapular fenestra either in the scapula or between the scapula and the coracoid. Mostly
  Marine Fishes, various in form, from the tropics to the Antarctic circle, some occurring at great
  depths. About 25 species, referable to 7 genera: <i>Leptoscopus</i>, <i>Parapercis</i>,
  <i>Neopercis</i>, <i>Pteropsaron</i>, <i>Bembrops</i>, <i>Pleuragramma</i>,
  <i>Chimarrhichthys</i>. The latter, from New Zealand, is the only freshwater form of the family,
  and is remarkably adapted for living in alpine torrents. <i>Pleuragramma antarcticum</i>, brought
  home by the Southern Cross Expedition, comes from 78&deg; 35&acute; S. lat., the farthest point at which
  fishes have yet been obtained in the Antarctic region. <i>Macrius amissus</i>, from the Pacific
  Ocean at a depth of 1000 fathoms, which, judging from a very imperfect description, probably
  belongs to this family, measures 5 feet, and is the largest known deep-sea Teleostean.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Nototheniidae.</b>&mdash;Also closely allied to the Trachinidae. No subocular shelf;
  a single nostril on each side; ventrals <span class="pagenum" id="page706"><span
  class="smaller">{706}</span></span>widely separated; pectoral arch usually as in the Trachinidae,
  but scapular fenestra sometimes in the scapula (<i>Trematomus</i>). Body varying much in shape
  according to the genera, the form sometimes suggestive of the Cottidae; scales usually ctenoid,
  sometimes absent; anterior (spinous) dorsal sometimes absent; lateral line often double, or even
  triple. Mostly from the Southern seas and the Antarctic circle. About 40 species, referable to 19
  genera, of which the following are the principal:&mdash;<i>Notothenia</i>, <i>Trematomus</i>,
  <i>Chaenichthys</i>, <i>Champsocephalus</i>, <i>Cryodraco</i>, <i>Acanthaphritis</i>,
  <i>Eleginops</i>, <i>Bovichthys</i>, <i>Gymnodraco</i>, <i>Gerlachia</i>, <i>Bathydraco</i>,
  <i>Racovitzaia</i>, <i>Harpagifer</i>, <i>Draconetta</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Uranoscopidae.</b>&mdash;Agree with the Trachinidae in general structure, and in the
  closely approximated ventrals. Scales very small, in oblique bands, or absent. Pterygials much
  reduced, fused with the scapula and the coracoid; scapular fenestra in the scapula. Parapophyses
  strongly developed on the praecaudal vertebrae, with the ribs attached to their upper surface. The
  head is very large, broad, partly covered with bony plates; cleft of the mouth vertical; eyes on
  the upper surface of the head. Vertebrae 25 to 30 (12-14 + 13-16). Four genera:
  <i>Uranoscopus</i>, <i>Anema</i>, <i>Cathetostoma</i>, <i>Ariscopus</i>, with 15 species, from the
  tropical seas, northwards to the Mediterranean and Japan, southwards to South Australia and New
  Zealand.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Trichonotidae.</b>&mdash;Small elongate fishes very nearly related to the
  Callionymidae, with which they agree in the arrangement of the bones at the base of the pectoral
  fins and the absence of epipleurals; but post-temporal more distinctly forked and detached from
  the skull, suborbital arch ossified (without subocular shelf), gill-openings wide, a single long
  dorsal fin, a long anal fin, and body covered with scales. Vertebrae 48-53. Five marine species,
  referable to 3 genera: <i>Trichonotus</i> and <i>Taeniolabrus</i> from the Indian Ocean, and
  <i>Hemerocoetes</i> from New Zealand.</p>

  <p>Small marine fishes, referable to 2 genera; <i>Callionymus</i>, with about 45 species, nearly
  cosmopolitan, and <i>Vulsus</i>, with a single species from Amboyna and Celebes. In the common
  British species, the Dragonet (<i>Callionymus lyra</i>), the male acquires very marked secondary
  characters, the snout becoming more elongate, the second dorsal fin much produced, and the body
  ornamented with yellow and blue bands. The courtship and pairing have been described by E. W. L.
  Holt,<a id="NtA_745" href="#Nt_745"><sup>[745]</sup></a> who observes that this curious fish

  <p>First placed with the Acanthopterygians by J. M&uuml;ller, notwithstanding the absence of spinous
  rays in the vertical fins, and removed from the vicinity of the Cyclopteridae by G&uuml;nther, raised
  to the rank of a Sub-order (Xenopteri) near the Anacanthini by Gill, the exact systematic position
  of this curious type of Fishes has long been a matter of uncertainty. The position of the ventral
  fins suggests, at first glance, affinity with the Callionymidae, and a comparison of the skeletons
  of these two types has convinced me that they are really related to each other, although both
  highly modified in different directions.</p>

  <p>The Cling-Fishes are curious small, carnivorous, Marine Fishes, usually found between
  tide-marks among loose stones and shells, to which they adhere firmly by means of the adhesive
  ventral disk. They can live a long time out of water. About 50 species are known, from various
  parts of the world, extending as far north as Scotland and Vancouver Island, and southwards to
  <span class="pagenum" id="page709"><span class="smaller">{709}</span></span>New Zealand. Three or
  four species, belonging to the genus <i>Lepadogaster</i>, are known to occur on the British
  coasts. The principal genera are <i>Gobiesox</i>, <i>Chorisochismus</i>, <i>Sicyases</i>,
  <i>Cotylis</i>, <i>Lepadogaster</i>, <i>Trachelochismus</i>, <i>Diplocrepis</i>,
  <i>Crepidogaster</i>, and <i>Leptopterygius</i>.<a id="NtA_748"

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Blenniidae.</b>&mdash;Suborbitals often forming a more or less distinct subocular
  shelf; mouth moderate or large, more or less protractile, often bordered to a considerable extent
  by the maxillaries. Most of the praecaudal vertebrae with strong transverse processes supporting
  the ribs, which may bear epipleurals. Gill-membranes usually attached to isthmus; 6 or 7
  branchiostegal rays; gills 4, a slit behind the fourth; pseudobranchiae usually present.
  Post-temporal forked; scapula and coracoid more or less developed, sometimes much reduced, the
  former pierced by a foramen; pectoral rays attached to 4 or 5 hour-glass-shaped pterygials, one or
  two of which are in contact with the coracoid. Ventral fins jugular, with not more than 4 rays, or
  absent. Body more or less elongate, sometimes Eel-shaped, naked or with small scales. Dorsal and
  anal fins elongate, the former constituted entirely of spines, or anteriorly of spines or
  non-articulated rays, and posteriorly of soft rays. Caudal fin usually distinct, with expanded
  hypural.</p>

  <p>A large family, mostly of small Marine Fishes, the arrangement of which still offers great
  difficulties. Whether the aberrant genera <i>Cerdale</i> and <i>Ptilichthys</i> deserve to be
  regarded as the types of distinct families cannot be decided until the skeleton has been examined.
  The species number about 350, from nearly all the seas, a few inhabiting fresh waters, and are
  referred to numerous genera, of which the following are the principal:&mdash;<i>Gadopsis</i>,
  <i>Enneanectes</i>, <i>Heterostichus</i>, <i>Acanthoclinus</i>, <i>Clinus</i>, <i>Emmnion</i>,
  <i>Blennius</i>, <i>Chasmodes</i>, <i>Petroscirtes</i>, <i>Xiphasia</i>, <i>Anarrhichas</i>,
  <i>Pataecus</i>, <i>Salarias</i>, <i>Ophioblennius</i>, <i>Anoplarchus</i>, <i>Xiphistes</i>,
  <i>Opisthocentrus</i>, <i>Chaenopsis</i>, <i>Pholedichthys</i>, <i>Lumpenus</i>. Remains of
  <i>Clinus</i> and <i>Blennius</i> have been described from the Miocene, and the extinct genus
  <i>Pterygocephalus</i>, from the Upper Eocene, is regarded as allied to <i>Clinus</i>.</p>

  <p>The Blenniidae are mostly carnivorous, but a few are herbivorous; some are viviparous
  (<i>Clinus</i>), others oviparous. Species <span class="pagenum" id="page710"><span
  class="smaller">{710}</span></span>of <i>Blennius</i> occur in abundance on our coasts, and are
  among the most familiar tenants of small rock-pools. Their habits have been admirably described by
  Guitel.<a id="NtA_749" href="#Nt_749"><sup>[749]</sup></a> The male makes a sort of nest, and
  defends the brood. Numerous species of the genus <i>Salarias</i> occur in the tropics; these
  little fish, as their name implies, are remarkable for the long leaps they are able to make. The
  largest of the Blenniids are the "Wolf-Fishes," often named "Cat-Fishes" (<i>Anarrhichas</i>), of
  which one species (<i>A. lupus</i>) is common on the British coasts, growing to a length of 5 or 6
  feet. "It is impossible," says Brown Goode, "to imagine a more voracious-looking animal than the
  Sea Cat-Fish, with the massive head and long sinuous, muscular body, its strongly rayed fins, its
  vice-like jaws, armed with great pavements of teeth, those in front long, strong, pointed, like
  those of a tiger. It has been known to attack furiously persons wading at low tide among the
  rock-pools." Its flesh is excellent eating, but generally despised in this country owing to the
  unprepossessing appearance of the animal.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 10. Batrachidae.</b>&mdash;Suborbital arch absent; basis cranii simple; mouth very
  large, slightly protractile, bordered to a great extent by the maxillaries. Vertebrae numerous,

  ankylosed to the skull; scapula and coracoid much reduced, 4 or 5 elongate pterygials, dilated
  distally, the two lower in contact with the coracoid. Ventral fins jugular, with 1 spine and 2 or
  3 branched rays. Gill-openings narrow, the gill-membranes broadly grown to the isthmus; gills 3;
  pseudobranchiae absent. Head broad and depressed; body naked or with small scales. Spinous dorsal
  very short, soft dorsal and anal long.</p>

  <p>This family is on the whole intermediate between the Blenniidae and the Pediculati. Sluggish,
  voracious, carnivorous Fishes from the shores of tropical and warm seas, some of them ascending
  rivers. The species number about 20, referable to <span class="pagenum" id="page711"><span
  class="smaller">{711}</span></span>5 genera: <i>Batrachus</i>, <i>Opsanus</i>,
  <i>Thalassophryne</i>, <i>Thalassothia</i>, and <i>Porichthys</i>. The eggs of <i>Batrachus
  tau</i> are very large, &frac14; inch in diameter, and are deposited in a little retreat provided by the
  parent; the male assumes the care of the brood; the young fasten themselves to rocks by means of
  an adhesive ventral disk, which soon disappears.<a id="NtA_751"
  href="#Nt_751"><sup>[751]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In <i>Thalassophryne</i>, from the coasts of Central America, the opercular spine and the two

  <p>Small shore fishes of the Northern Seas, differing from the Blenniidae in the structure of the
  praecaudal vertebrae, in spite of the external resemblance which the two known genera,

  <p>A well-known British fish of this family is the little Gunnel or Butter-Fish (<i>Pholis
  gunnellus</i>), remarkable for the manner in which the female protects her offspring, coiling
  herself round the eggs, which she rolls up into a ball about the size of a Brazil nut, in holes of
  the boring Mollusc (<i>Pholas</i>). The male sometimes assists the female.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 12. Zoarcidae.</b>&mdash;Suborbitals not forming a subocular shelf; mouth feebly

  <p>Two genera. The most generalised is <i>Trachypterus</i>, of which probably only 10 forms are
  entitled to specific distinction. The best known species is <i>T. arcticus</i>, the Deal-Fish or
  Northern Ribbon-Fish, which reaches a length of 8 feet or more, and of which a few specimens have
  been stranded on the coasts of Scotland. Nilsson, who has observed these fishes alive on the
  Scandinavian coast, says they approach the shore at flood-tide on sandy shelving bottoms, and are
  often left by the retreating waves; that they move with one side turned obliquely upward, and that
  they lie on the side like Flat-Fishes on the bottom in 2 or 3 fathoms of water. <i>Regalecus</i>
  differs in the presence of a single ray to the ventral and the absence of the caudal fin. Some 5
  or 6 species may be distinguished. <i>R. glesne</i>, the Oar-fish, or "King of the Herrings," is
  the best known and the largest species, reaching a length of over 20 feet. About 25 <span
  class="pagenum" id="page716"><span class="smaller">{716}</span></span>specimens are known to have
  occurred on the British coasts. Some of the accounts of "Sea-Serpents" are probably based on this
  fish, which has been observed to swim with undulating motion and with a small portion of the head
  as well as the crest-like anterior part of the dorsal fin above the water.</p>

  <p>The fish named <i>Stylophorus chordatus</i>, which has been referred to this family, is known
  from a single specimen too imperfectly preserved to afford a clear idea of its affinities.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Lophotidae.</b>&mdash;Mouth moderately protractile; ventrals very small, if
  distinct, with 4 or 5 rays; abdominal cavity extending nearly the whole length of the much
  elongated body, the vent very far back and followed by a short anal fin; caudal fin small, not
  divided.</p>

  <p class="sp3">A single genus, <i>Lophotes</i>, with 3 or 4 species, from the Mediterranean, the
  tropical Atlantic, the Cape of Good Hope, Japan, and New Zealand, reaching a length of 6 feet or
  more. The dorsal fin commences with an extremely long and strong spine on the head, which is much
  elevated and truncate in front.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Sub-Order 11. Opisthomi</b></p>

  <p>Air-bladder without open duct. Opercle well developed, hidden under the skin; supraoccipital in
  contact with the frontals, separating the parietals. Pectoral arch suspended from the vertebral
  column, far behind the skull; no mesocoracoid. Vertical fins with spines. Ventral fins absent.</p>

  <p>This division stands in the same relation to the Acanthopterygii as do the Apodes to the
  Malacopterygii. The single family is possibly derived from the Blenniidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Mastacembelidae.</b>&mdash;Body more or less Eel-shaped; a series of short spines
  detached from the very elongate dorsal fin, which is more or less confluent with the likewise very

  praemaxillaries, to the upper border of which the maxillaries are attached. Gill-cleft inferior;
  gills 4; branchiostegal rays 6; no pseudobranchiae. Vertebrae numerous (72-95), the praecaudals
  with transverse processes bearing the ribs. Scales very small.</p>

  species are known, referable to <span class="pagenum" id="page717"><span
  class="smaller">{717}</span></span>two genera: <i>Mastacembelus</i> and <i>Rhynchobdella</i>. The
  largest species reach a length of three feet. Little is known of their habits. Of the Indian
  <i>Rhynchobdella aculeata</i>, Day says it conceals itself in the mud and becomes drowned in water

  post-temporal is flat and ankylosed to the cranium, and the suprascapula is much elongated. The
  pterygials, two or three in number, are separated from the small scapula and coracoid by a broad
  ligament, the arm-like pectorals being more or less distinctly geniculated and inserted far back
  behind the cranium. The head is large, the basis cranii simple. The gills are reduced to 2, 2&frac12;, or

  <p>Twelve species, referable to three genera (<i>Lophius</i>, <i>Chirolophius</i>, and

  <p>The Fishing-Frog or Angler (<i>Lophius piscatorius</i>) has a wide distribution, occurring on
  the coasts of Europe and North America. The first dorsal ray, inserted on the snout, is very long,
  movable in every direction, and terminates in a dermal flap, which is supposed to be used by the
  "Angler" as a bait, attracting other fishes, which are soon ingulfed in the enormous gape. It
  grows to a length of over 5 feet. The ventral rays are very elongate in the young.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Ceratiidae.</b>&mdash;Mouth extremely large, terminal, with strong cardiform teeth.
  Gill-opening in lower axil of pectoral; pseudobranchiae absent. Pectoral fin scarcely geniculated,
  with three pterygials. Ventral fins absent. Spinous dorsal fin usually present, sometimes reduced
  to a single tentacle on the snout. Skin naked.</p>

  <p>The members of this family, about 25 in number, are all inhabitants of great depths (300-2600
  fathoms). The colour of the body is usually a deep black, and the first dorsal spine, on the head,
  may terminate in a luminous bulb with or without filaments. "The Bathybial Sea-devils," writes
  G&uuml;nther, "are degraded forms of <i>Lophius</i>; they descend to the greatest depths of the ocean.
  Their bones are of an extremely light and thin texture, and frequently other parts of their
  organisation, their integuments, muscles, and intestines are equally loose in texture when the
  specimens are brought to the surface. In their habits they probably do not differ in any degree
  from their surface representative, <i>Lophius</i>."</p>

  <p>The species of <i>Antennarius</i> live mostly in coral groves, where they lie in wait for prey,
  well concealed by their protective coloration and the harmonising aspect of their integument and
  appendages. To this genus also belongs the "Marbled Angler" (<i>A. marmoratus</i>), carried about
  in mid ocean among the <i>Sargassum</i> weed, to rest on which, from its peculiar arm-like
  pectoral fins, it is specially fitted; there it makes its wonderful nest of silk-like fibres,
  probably secreted by the parent as in the Sticklebacks, with large bundles of eggs hanging like
  grape clusters.<a id="NtA_757" href="#Nt_757"><sup>[757]</sup></a> The deep-sea <i>Chaunax</i>

  spine at the end of the long, movable pelvis. Body covered with juxtaposed movable scutes or with
  minute rough scales.</p>

  <p>About 100 species are known from the tropical and warm seas, one species (<i>Balistes
  capriscus</i>) occasionally wandering as far north as the south coast of England. Genera:
  <i>Balistes</i>, <i>Monacanthus</i>, <i>Paraluteres</i>, <i>Pseudaluteres</i>,
  <i>Pseudomonacanthus</i>, <i>Aluteres</i>, <i>Psilocephalus</i>. The Oligocene genus
  <i>Acanthoderma</i> is closely allied to <i>Balistes</i>.</p>

  <p>The "File-Fishes" or "Trigger-Fishes" (<i>Balistes</i>), the largest species of which grow to
  nearly 3 feet, have a powerful dentition, which enables them to break off pieces of corals, on
  which they feed, and to bore holes in the hard shells of Mollusca in order to extract the soft
  parts; they are themselves well protected by a mail of hard, rhomboidal scales. The herbivorous
  <i>Monacanthus</i> is less favoured in this respect, the rough scales being so small as to give
  the skin a velvety appearance.</p>

  <p><i>Psilocephalus</i> differs from <i>Monacanthus</i> in its very elongate head and body, the
  very feeble dorsal spine, the presence of a mental barbel, and its more numerous vertebrae (29 or
  30 instead of 18 to 21). The flesh of many of these fishes is poisonous.<a id="NtA_760"
  href="#Nt_760"><sup>[760]</sup></a> The drumming sounds produced by <i>Balistes</i> have been

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Ostraciontidae.</b>&mdash;Praemaxillaries not protractile, firmly united to the
  praemaxillaries; teeth incisor-like; palatine immovable. Gills 4. Praecaudal vertebrae with very
  feeble parapophyses and no epipleurals. No spinous dorsal fin. Clavicles, coracoids, and
  post-clavicles much expanded. No ventral fins. Body encased in a carapace formed of large,
  juxtaposed, mostly hexagonal bony plates. Vertebrae 14 to 16.</p>

  <p>The species of "Trunk-Fishes" number about 20, and are referable to 3 genera: <i>Aracana</i>,
  <i>Ostracion</i>, <i>Lactophrys</i>; all belong to the tropical seas, living near the bottom in
  shallow water. The genus <i>Ostracion</i> is represented by one species in the Upper Eocene.</p>

  <p>The rigid box in which these fishes are encased entails more use of the dorsal and anal fins
  for progression than is customary <span class="pagenum" id="page725"><span
  class="smaller">{725}</span></span>among fishes. According to Brown Goode, "the propelling force
  is exerted by the dorsal and anal fins, which have a half rotary, sculling motion, resembling that
  of a screw propeller; the caudal fin acts as a rudder, save when it is needed for unusually rapid
  swimming, when it is used as in other fishes; the chief function of the broad pectorals seems to
  be that of forming a current of water through the gills, thus aiding respiration, which would
  otherwise be difficult on account of the narrowness and inflexibility of the branchial apertures.
  When taken from the water, one of these fishes will live for two or three hours, all the time
  solemnly fanning its gills, and when restored to its native element seems none the worse for its
  experience, except that, on account of the air absorbed, it cannot at once sink to the bottom."
  "No group of tropical fishes," says the same author, "is so thoroughly worked out in the writings
  of the fathers of natural history as this one. Over 200 years ago every species of trunk-fish now
  taken from the Atlantic was known to and described by the naturalists, and it is a well-deserved
  tribute to their discrimination as zoologists to say that none of the many efforts which have
  since been made to subdivide their species have been at all successful."</p>

    <p><i>CAMBRIDGE REVIEW</i>.&mdash;"Several of the groups treated of in this volume are unknown
    by sight even, to the general reader, and possess no popular name whatsoever; and as only a few
    insignificant details are known of the habits of the animals composing them, their treatment in
    the volume before us has necessarily been to a large extent anatomical. This circumstance
    renders the book of especial value to students, more particularly as in some cases the articles
    on the groups in question are the first comprehensive ones dealing with their respective
    subjects.... Most of the articles are of a very high order of merit&mdash;taken as a whole, it
    may be said that they are by far the best which have as yet been published.... We may say with
    confidence that the same amount of information, within the same compass, is to be had in no
    other zoological work."</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>NATURAL SCIENCE</i>.&mdash;"This second volume of the Cambridge Natural
    History is certain to prove a most welcome addition to English Zoological literature. It deals
    with a series of animal groups, all deeply interesting to the specialist in morphology; some
    important from their economic relations to other living things, others in their life-histories
    rivalling the marvels of fairy-tales. And the style in which they are here treated is also
    interesting; history and the early observations of the older writers lend their charm; accounts
    of habits and mode of occurrence, of life, in a word, from the cradle to the grave, are given in
    ample detail, accompanied by full references to modern and current literature. The whole is
    admirably illustrated."</p>

    <p><i>SATURDAY REVIEW</i>.&mdash;"Dr. Sharp's treatment is altogether worthy of the series and
    of his own high scientific reputation. But in a work of this sort it is not only necessary that
    information should be accurate, but also that it shall be presented to the eye, so far as
    illustrations and printing are concerned, in such a way as to render its matter as easily
    intelligible as possible, and readily usable for purposes of reference. Under both these heads
    we have nothing but commendation for Mr. Sharp's treatise. The illustrations are indeed
    beautiful, and the use of the heavy type for the headings of the various sections and leading
    paragraphs materially helps the reader in the progress of his study. Certainly this is a book
    that should be in every entomologist's library."</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>DAILY NEWS</i>.&mdash;"It would be hard to say too much in praise of this most
    admirable volume. It is too often the case that scientific books are written in a dull and
    uninteresting style. The reader will find nothing of that kind to complain of here. The
    descriptions are clear, the illustrations are excellent; while, as in the previous volumes of
    the series, printing and paper are all that could be desired."</p>

    expert, and at the same time entertain the reader who is merely interested in the tit-bits of
    natural history.... A book full of accurate information and pleasant reading."</p>
    <p><i>MORNING POST</i>.&mdash;"A delightful as well as a serviceable book.... Herein perhaps
    lies the great charm and merit of Dr. Gadow's book, that, while satisfying all the inquiries of
    the student, it is also in great part written for the ordinary intelligence, and the naturalist
    in the crowd may, while necessarily gliding over distressing technicalities, find in its pages
    many hours of profitable and entertaining study of the habits of the classes under notice."</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>NATURE</i>.&mdash;"In concluding the review we would express the opinion that
    by this handsome volume a very important addition to science has been made; that the beautiful
    illustrations, together with the clear and charming accounts of the life-histories which it
    contains, will do much to popularise the study of a rather neglected section of zoology; and
    that lovers of Reptiles, of which there are more than one generally thinks, will feel that the

    Actinistia, and Cladistia. The first sub-order is reserved for the Tarrasiidae, a family which
    includes only the little known <i>Tarrasius problematicus</i> from the Lower Carboniferous of
    Scotland.</p>

    <p>Vaillant was inclined to take a different view, but with considerable diffidence, owing to
    his inability actually to trace an open duct. I believe G&uuml;nther to be right on this point, as
    well as in his account of the suspension of the pectoral arch in <i>Notacanthus</i>, which I
    have been able to verify. Besides, Mr. W. S. Rowntree, who has great experience in these
    matters, has kindly examined at my request a well-preserved example of <i>Halosauropsis
    macrochir</i>, and informs me that "the air-bladder passes anteriorly into a tapering band of
    tissue which ends in a thread-like ligament attached to the stomach near its posterior end and
    in the mid-dorsal line&mdash;not to the oesophagus; no trace of an open communication could be

    <p><i>Protaulopsis</i>, from Monte Bolca, appears to me to belong to the Scombresocidae. The
    anterior vertebrae are equal in size; long, slender ribs are present, the body is scaly, and the

    <p>Swinnerton (<i>Quart. J. Micr. Sci</i>. xlv. 1902, p. 554) has pointed out that the skull of
    the Scombresoces belongs to what he terms the Acrartete type (<i>i.e.</i> in which the
    attachment of the palatine cartilage or its derivates is confined to the pre-ethmoid cornua),
    whilst the other Percesoces examined by him, as well as the Cyprinodonts are Disartete (the
    attachment being at the parethmoid and pre-ethmoid cornua); but the character is so indistinctly
    defined in some adult Cyprinodonts that I feel some diffidence in making use of this character
    for systematic purposes in the present state of our knowledge.</p>

    <p>The increased number of pectoral pterygials has been regarded by Sagemehl (<i>Morphol.
    Jahrb</i>. x. 1885, p. 17) as indicating generalisation, and has been a great stumbling-block in
    his discussion of the affinities of <i>Gymnotus</i> with the other Ostariophysi, and especially
    the Characinidae. The fact that the same feature is repeated in three such distinct families as
    the Gymnotidae, Anguillidae, and Muraenolepididae, and occurs in genera which are in all other
    respects more specialised than their neighbours, goes far to prove that Sagemehl was mistaken in
    his interpretation of this character.</p>
